> Wednesday at the prayer meeting, Pastor Thacker read Psalm 109, which was challenging in an unexpected way. The language used in this Psalm may shock us. But the Psalms should inform our worldview and prayer life. In an era of soft Christianity, the Psalms can do much for our backbone. Here’s David praying against his (and God’s) enemies in Psalm 109:
>
>> When he is judged, let him be found guilty,  
>> And let his prayer become sin.  
>> Let his days be few,  
>> And let another take his office.  
>> Let his children be fatherless,  
>> And his wife a widow.  
>> Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg;  
>> Let them seek their bread also from their desolate places.  
>> Let the creditor seize all that he has,  
>> And let strangers plunder his labor.  
>
> What is your reaction to these words? Do you recoil against such language? Are similar words readily on your lips regarding God’s enemies; your enemies? As I prayed Wednesday for a situation where Christ’s enemies seek harm, I was searching for words that did not readily come, even after reading Psalm 109. So the challenge before us is this: spend time in the Psalms and be bold to pray the words God has given us. And when we pray as God has demonstrated to us and shape our lives after this pattern, we will find abundant blessing and strength of faith!
