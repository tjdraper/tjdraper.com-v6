This is a head scratcher to me. Obviously I'm not saying, and Leanna is not saying that she is entitled to some sort of discount from AT&T, but simply that they have in the past offered this to early iPhone upgraders to keep them happy. It seems like a really bad decision to make iPhone owners upset right now, and particularly to make the early termination fee work out so that it's a little cheaper to pay the fee and go to Verizon than to pay the fee and stay with AT&T.

The reason it is particularly head scratching is because AT&T is not in a good position to be angering it's LTE iPhone customers. Verizon is ahead of AT&T on LTE roll out so far right now that it's laughable. I think they may want to re-think this strategy for customer retention.
