> We [recently wrote](http://www.bgr.com/2012/09/13/iphone-5-announcement-analysis-disappointing/) that following all the leaks and rumors leading up to the [iPhone 5](http://www.bgr.com/tag/iphone-5) unveiling, the only thing more predictable than the new [iPhone](http://www.bgr.com/tag/iphone) itself was people’s reactions to it. Well, the only thing even more predictable than response to the iPhone 5 was the fact that preorders would sell out quickly. [Apple](http://www.bgr.com/tag/apple) ([AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL)) made preorders of its new iPhone available on apple.com at 3:01 a.m. EDT, 12:01 a.m. PDT and in less than one hour, the company’s initial stock of new iPhones for [Verizon Wireless](http://www.bgr.com/tag/verizon) ([VZ](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VZ)), [AT&T](http://www.bgr.com/tag/att) ([T](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=T)) and [Sprint](http://www.bgr.com/tag/sprint) ([S](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=S)) was depleted.

So disappointing.
