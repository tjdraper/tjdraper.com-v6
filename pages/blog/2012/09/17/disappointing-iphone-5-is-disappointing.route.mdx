> One glaring omission from the list of Apple upgrades is Siri, the iPhone’s speech recognition “assistant.” It appears that Siri will still be tied to the network, meaning slow response speeds and giving the edge to Android speech-to-text.

I'm sorry, did someone expect Apple to move their Siri database to the phone locally? Was this a thing someone, somewhere thought Apple would do? Given the processing power limitations and storage space limitations today, I don't think it's possible to do what Apple is trying to do with Siri on a local database only.

> Apple also gave only fleeting attention to battery life, with 8 hours of 3G browsing and 8 hours of LTE browsing.

> There was no word on 4G talk time, which may not be a good sign for the phone’s battery life. Or, that could mean it will switch to 3G for talk.

Seriously, where do these "journalists"? There's actually no question that the iPhone will fall back to 3G technologies for talk since VoLTE (Voice over LTE) has not yet launched on any major carrier. All LTE phones on most carriers currently fall back to 3G and 2G technologies for talk. So the reason Apple didn't mention 4G talk time is because it does not currently exist.

"Journalist" indeed.
