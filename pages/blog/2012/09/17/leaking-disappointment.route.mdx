One of the more strange phenomenons that takes place is the "disappointment" surrounding iPhone events for the last couple versions of the iPhone. Consider.

[ZDNet - iPhone 5 has enterprise potential, but disappointing overall](http://www.zdnet.com/iphone-5-has-enterprise-potential-but-disappointing-overall-7000004202/):

> For consumers, though, the iPhone 5 will not be evolutionary like the iPhone 3 and iPhone 4 was in terms of form factor, user experience and software, Nath said, adding that the latest release is not very different in terms of the way it looks and behaves.
>
> The new smartphone also had been "highly hyped" with many carrying high expectations, especially since they had expected the iPhone 5 to be unveiled last year but [got iPhone 4S instead](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/analysts-disappointing-iphone-4s-could-be-fastest-selling-to-date/60175), he noted.

Don't get me started about how utterly stupid that business about "they expected iPhone 5 but got 4S instead" is.

Extreme Tech, in an article with the link baity title, "[The iPhone 5: Less innovation than Android and WP8, in a bigger package](http://www.extremetech.com/electronics/136100-the-iphone-5-less-innovation-than-android-and-wp8-in-a-bigger-package)," says:

> The rest of the hardware is nothing to really write home about. It has a [faster dual-core processor](http://www.extremetech.com/mobile/136085-whats-inside-the-iphone-5s-a6-soc), but lots of phones do. It has LTE, which is also commonplace. There’s no NFC, which I still think is a mistake even without a payment platform (sharing content with NFC is extremely handy). Instead of adding interesting hardware features, it seems like Apple spent its time making the phone very pretty.

> There were plenty of rumors about what Apple was going to do with those extra pixels on the iPhone’s screen. Surely [the previous iOS 6 announcement](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/130797-apple-ios-6-vs-android-google-has-some-work-to-do) wouldn’t have revealed everything, right? Actually, there was no grand plan to revolutionize the interface — the extra resolution went to another row of icons. This seems like the most boring use Apple could have come up with.

Wired, again with the asinine title, "[The iPhone 5 Is Completely Amazing and Utterly Boring](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/09/the-iphone-5-is-boring-and-amazing/)" says:

> Yes, it’s better than the iPhone 4S or the iPhone 4 or just about any other phone you can buy. It’s faster with a bigger screen and an LTE antenna so you can suck up data from your carrier like Michael Phelps at a table full of pizza. But mostly it is the Toyota Prius of phone updates. It is an amazing triumph of technology that gets better and better, year after year, and yet somehow is every bit as exciting as a 25 mph drive through a sensible neighborhood at a reasonable time of day. It’s not going to change your life. It’s not even going to offer a radically different experience.

I could go on, and on and on. There are a lot of articles and posts about how "disappointing" the iPhone 5 is. But as it turns out, perhaps the iPhone 5 wasn't as disappointing to consumers as it was to technology journalists with their head up… Ahem, anyway. [The Wall Street Journal reports](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443995604578001920943462306.html):

> [Apple](http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=T) Inc. said customers placed more than 2 million preorders for the iPhone 5 on the first day it was available, doubling previous results and exceeding initial supply of the smartphone.

...

> The initial reception surpassed sales of the device's predecessor, the iPhone 4S, which received more than 1 million preorders during its first day of requests Oct. 7, and easily tops the 600,000 handsets preordered after the debut of the iPhone 4.
>
> Apple executives have said that each new iPhone has outsold all of its predecessors combined as the smartphone reaches new markets and expands within existing ones.

Huh. Well look at that. Consumers did not agree with the journalists and analysts. They thought the iPhone 5 was just dandy. What gives?

I think this disappointment is a direct result of the fact that Apple has sprung several leaks in it's normally tightly sealed ship. Secrecy has always been Apple's ally in the past, but as Apple gets bigger, sells more devices, and grabs more of the watching world's attention, it becomes very, very hard to keep secrets. Third party supply chains leak, unscrupulous employees let things slip out, and human mistakes are bound to happen.

When Apple announced the first iPhone and blew the world away with the undeniably sleek and awe inspiring device, no one knew _anything_ about it. No one outside Apple had seen it, indeed few inside of Apple had seen the device in full. And it was completely revolutionary. Consider also that this was six months before the device began shipping, and before suppliers began ramping up production. Coupled with the fact that the world was not yet really watching Apple in this space, and you have a very well kept secret.

Now the problem is Apple has already revolutionized the space so they don't have anything as earth shattering as that first iPhone to announce. And supply chains just can't keep their big fat mouths shut. I, and all these tech journalists and analysts already knew pretty much everything there was to know about the iPhone 5. So the lack of anything new beyond what had leaked, let alone earth shatteringly revolutionary, was seen as a disappointment by certain people who do not represent the average consumer. When the pre-order gates opened, the average consumer was polled, and the vote is in. The people have spoken, and they like it.

In the end, Apple still makes the best smartphone by miles, and they keep pushing it forward. Disappointing? The best Smartphone on the market, disappointing? Whatever you say people.
