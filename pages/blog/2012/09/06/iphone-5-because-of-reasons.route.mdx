No, it doesn’t technically make sense — it is the sixth iteration of the iPhone — and yet, at the same time, it makes all the sense in the world. It’s the iPhone 5 because that’s what everyone is calling it. Sometimes it is that simple.

It's still strange though, becuase I counted on my fingers and toes, and the next iPhone will be the 6th generation iPhone. Calling it the iPhone 5 just seems odd. But, Apple will do what Apple wants to do I suppose.

Also, I love MG's headline.
