> Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan is barnstorming the country, promising to repeal every provision of the Affordable Care Act if the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected. But a letter he wrote to the Obama administration may undermine this message.

...

> The letter, among several obtained by _The Nation_ and [The Investigative Fund](http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/) through a Freedom of Information Act request, is a stark reminder that even the most ardent opponents of Obamacare privately acknowledge many of the lawâ€™s benefits.

...

> Ryan first [denied](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/17/news/la-pn-paul-ryan-now-says-his-office-requested-stimulus-funds-20120817) responsibility for the stimulus grant requests, but later confessed that his office had sent the letters.

Your "conservative" Republican ticket...
