> While it is true that many Christians have avoided altogether any discussion over Romneyâ€™s profession of faith in a false god, yet the objections to Romney, as a Mormon, are overturned or dismissed via a historical answer that has been used before in past candidates; namely that Obama is much worse. No doubt this statement is true, but the political environment of the moment does not set our standard for leadership, God does.

I disagree that Obama is much worse, I in fact see little difference between the two, but still worth a read.
