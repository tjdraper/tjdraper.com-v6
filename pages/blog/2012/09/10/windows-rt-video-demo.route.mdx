> Now that Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows RT operating systems [have been finalized](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3188541/windows-8-rtm-development-complete), we're starting to see more and more ARM-based Windows RT tablets from OEMs. At IFA 2012 this week, [Dell](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3279058/dell-xps-10-windows-rt-tablet), [Samsung](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/29/3277059/samsung-ativ-tab-specs-windows-rt-announcement), and [Asus](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/29/3276484/asus-vivo-tab-vivo-tab-rt-tablets-windows-8-windows-rt) all had their Windows RT-powered tablets on display. We've seen [some prototypes](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3064818/toshiba-windows-8-devices-prototypes/in/2834848) running [older builds](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3064839/qualcomm-winrt-snapdragon-s4-reference-tablet) of Windows RT, and even [production models](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/4/3062235/asus-tablet-600-windows-rt-tablet-windows-8/in/2834848) running the new operating system â€” but most vendors have been reluctant to let us get a good look at Microsoft's ARM OS.

Wow, this looks really awful.
