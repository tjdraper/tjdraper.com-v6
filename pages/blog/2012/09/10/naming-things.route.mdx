> The reason Apple dropped model numbers with the iPad has seemed obvious to me for months: because they’re going to be selling the current “new iPad” alongside the yet to be announced iPad mini.

...

> Now that Apple has sent out invitations to the new iPhone event with clear hints that it will be called the iPhone 5, the only thing we can be pretty sure about is that Apple will not introduce an iPhone mini/nano alongside the iPhone 5. When Apple finally does drop the model number from the iPhone, expect an iPhone with a new form factor to be introduced within a year.

Interesting analysis.
