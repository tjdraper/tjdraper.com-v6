I have not yet watched the [video of the event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2012/), and it’s starting to look like with all the things I have going on I just won’t have the time. But I did follow the live-blogging of the event and I know what went on, and of course I know all the details about the iPhone 5. My geek card is intact.

Six, or Five?
-------------

Apple has by all appearances lost the ability to count and put a 5 in the name of their sixth generation iPhone. Yes, that’s right, the iPhone 5 is really the iPhone 6. The math works like this:

-   iPhone (first generation)
-   iPhone 3G (second generation)
-   iPhone 3GS (third generation)
-   iPhone 4 (fourth generation)
-   iPhone 4S (fifth generation)
-   iPhone 5 (sixth generation) (huh???)

So what gives? As much as it annoys the ever living stuffing out of me, sometimes Apple just rolls with the punches so to speak. Everyone and their mother and brother and… well everyone but a handful of us nerds have been referring to the phone that comes after the iPhone 4S as the iPhone 5. Everyone was disappointed that the 4S wasn’t the iPhone 5. Everyone assumed that the next iPhone would be the iPhone 5. So I think Apple really just figured it would be way too much trouble to convince everyone that iPhone 6 was a logical name. They didn’t want to deal with everyone who would be talking about how Apple skipped a generation. Everyone was already calling it the iPhone 5 and anticipating it, they had the mindshare and the expectation. So: [iPhone 5](http://www.apple.com/iphone/).

Lanky Teenager
--------------

With the iPhone 5, iPhone is now in that awkward teenage growth stage where it suddenly shoots up but doesn’t put on any weight. Well okay the analogy starts to break down because I don’t know that I want it wider. The truth be told I’m not jazzed about it being taller either. I am very happy with the size of my 4S. These big boat Android phones are really uncomfortable to use frankly, and I don’t want a big iPhone.

But I think that, again, Apple has to make a phone that others want. No, Apple doesn’t cave to the demands of what people think they want as a general rule. But on the other hand, they do have to strike a balance here — make a good phone, make a marketable phone. For some reason people have it in their heads that bigger is better [1](#fn:notaste) and it was getting to the point where the iPhone was the smallest smartphone on the market. So to some extent, I think Apple felt that they needed to make the phone bigger.

Another problem with the perception of people is that most think they need change for the sake of change. When the new iPhone comes out, there’s always irritation from various people that it is essentially the same phone with slightly better internals. The problem of course is that the iPhone is the best phone it can be, how do you make it better? Not by changing it for the sake of change, that’s for sure. So this time, Apple has changed the form factor slightly — they’ve made it taller.

One more angle on the taller design. I think Apple is running up against the limitations of the battery technology available today. We all, including me, gripe and moan about the battery life of our iPhones, but this is the fact of the matter, iPhone is very battery efficient. Apple has squeezed out every bit of battery they can, but they want to make a faster, better phone. They upgraded the internals and they need a bigger battery to power those internals for the same amount of time. A taller iPhone allows for a bigger battery.

Design Language
---------------

Coming back to my point about not changing for the sake of change, one of the things that is remarkable about the iPhone 5 is how much like the iPhone 4 and 4S it actually is. Just glancing at it, you may not immediately identify it as a different model of iPhone than the iPhone 4 and 4S. Of course it wouldn’t take long to fix that perception with just a slight study of the phone, but at a glance it looks a lot like the previous two phones. It is, in many ways a more refined version of the iPhone 4/4S design language. Though of course I have yet to get my hands on one, it looks like they’ve gone to the next level with the fit and finish, slightly beveling the edges of the antenna band and things like that.

And they did fix one important thing that I have always thought was just a little odd about the iPhone 4 design: they changed the back of the phone to something a little less breakable. Making both the front and the back of the phone out of glass may look cool, but why make parts of the phone that don’t need to be glass out of glass when that makes it more breakable? When I first saw the leaks of the aluminum back with glass top and bottom [2](#fn:radiotransparency), I was not at all sure I liked it, but the design has grown on me. And I certainly favor the idea of a less breakable back on the iPhone, though I have never cracked one myself.

The Long Term Evolution
-----------------------

iPhone 5, as expected, is a 4G LTE capable phone. This is not surprising since the iPad came out earlier this year with the capability as well. Apple has done well here too in that the iPhone 5 battery life is not worse than the iPhone 4S. This is a rarity in the emerging radio technology world. Anyone who keeps up with cellular radio technology knows that in the early stages of new cellular radio technology development, those new radios are power-hungry and big. Yet Apple has managed to cram all the radio technologies they need onto one chip. This is a huge feat and they did it at a slight cost. Though Apple does and will do it’s best to make this process transparent to the user, there are actually [3 variants of the iPhone 5](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/12/apple_to_sell_3_variants_of_iphone_5_for_international_lte_coverage). This is necessary because of the divergent radio technologies and frequencies among carriers. Those three models are as follows:

-   **AT&T and Canada Version (GSM model A1428)**
    This model supports UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA on 850, 900, 1900, and 2100 MHz, GSM/EDGE on the same frequencies, and LTE bands 4 and 17.
-   **Verizon and Sprint (CDMA Model A1429)**
    This model supports CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B on 800, 1900, and 2100 MHz, UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA on 850, 900, 1900, and 2100 MHz), GSM/EDGE on 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, and LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25.
-   **Europe and Asia (GSM model A1429)**
    This model supports UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA on 850, 900, 1900, and 2100 MHz, GSM/EDGE on 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, and LTE bands 1, 3, 5.

As you can see the primary discrepancy is the LTE bands each phone supports (though the CDMA version certainly seems crammed with radio technology). You know it had to kill Apple to do this, but if they didn’t support LTE I suspect there would have been a bit of backlash. And the 3 models seems the be the price paid for supporting LTE. And really, in the long run, this is fine. Most people buy carrier specific phones and sign two year contracts so it works out fine.

Making Connections
------------------

The iPhone 5 features an all new Dock [Lightning connector](http://www.macworld.com/article/1168555/what_apples_new_lightning_connector_means_for_you.html). It is far smaller and it’s reversible (yes!). Contrary to what some people love to spout off, I do not believe Apple did this because they could, or because they like changing one proprietary standard for another. I think they did it because they needed to. Those opposed to this connector are divide into two camps. The first think that Apple should have just gone to, yea, should have always just used the Micro USB standard [3](#fn:micro). The second camp grumble that Apple didn’t need to change the connector and they’re just doing it to be mean and sell a lot of adapters and a lot of new accessories.

But the fact of the matter is the iPhone has been using borrowed technology in this department since it’s inception. The iPod Dock connector has been around since 2003. It’s nine-year-old technology, it’s big and bulky and un-Apple like at this point. And it was getting in the way of designing a smaller, thinner, and better iPhone. The Dock connector had a good run and long life. It was time for retirement.

Pods
----

Another thing that the new iPhone will be coming with is the redesigned set of headphones they are calling EarPods. This is another area where I am glad to see Apple doing something. I have made do with the earbuds Apple previously included with their iPhones but they have never been great. And I have always had trouble keeping those things in my ears. While I have not yet used these new EarPods, they look like they will be far better. Those that have had a chance to play with Apple’s new EarPods say the quality of both the build, and the sound are far better.

Evolution
---------

The iPhone 5, while sporting perhaps the most radical design change yet in changing the dimensions of the screen, is still an evolutionary upgrade to the best smart phone on the planet. And that is not a knock against it. I remember having this type of conversation with people about the Unibody MacBook Pro. “Hey TJ, do you think next year they will redesign the MacBook Pro?” “No.” “Well they need to do something, it’s got to look new and better and shiner!” “Why?” And that’s the question isn’t it? Why? More to the point, why would you redesign something that is already the best? That’s why, when the retina MacBook Pro came out, it looked like a Unibody MacBook Pro. There’s nothing to redesign, it’s already as good as it can be with the technology available. The same holds true for the iPhone in my opinion. What would you change about the design language? Those minor things that I would have wanted changed did change. But since I think the overall design language of the iPhone is top of its class, why change it?

So Will I Put My Money Where My Mouth Is?
-----------------------------------------

Well, no. See I upgraded to the 4S just a little less than a year ago. I upgrade my phone every two years. And even if I were eligible for AT&T’s midway point subsidy [4](#fn:subsidy), I really am not interested in signing another contract with AT&T right now. I have the itch to jump to Verizon again, a real bad itch to do so. I’m hoping it will be feasible next year when my contract is up with AT&T.

Interesting side note, it’s anecdotal, but almost every single person I follow on Twitter who is getting an iPhone 5 is switching from AT&T to Verizon. It makes me wonder if the mass exodus from AT&T predicted when Verizon got the iPhone was just delayed. I really think it’s because AT&T is so far behind on their LTE roll out [5](#fn:behind). It will be interesting to watch what happens on that front.

The iPhone 5 is a good phone and if I were in the market to upgrade, the iPhone 5 would certainly be the phone I would get.
