> While I’m still not positive App.net will be successful long-term, it’s been fun to relive the early days of Twitter with this new service.

...

> Twitter wants everyone to experience the service they way _they_ intend it, not a developer — no matter how great the third-party app or service might be. The reality is that Twitter just doesn’t like third-party clients — they are afraid of them. They are afraid that users will fall in love with a client and its services, and forget that Twitter is what’s underneath. That, coupled with the fact that currently third-party apps don’t pass along promoted tweets and other ads, is why Twitter is killing them off. Twitter’s doing it slowly, but have no doubt — it’s happening.

I have not been willling to spend any amount of money on a social network yet, let alone $50.00. And I still have concerns, even with AppDotNet. But I really don't like where Twitter is headed either.
