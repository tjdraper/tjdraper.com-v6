> My only related disappointment is that the update isn't available soon. The new iTunes should be released late October, according to Apple. If you ask me, they could have waited to announce it at their upcoming October event to keep things simpler.

This seemed like a strange one to me as well. Why announce the new version of iTunes and then tell us it will be out in a month? I don't get it. The updates look nice, but not headline enough to distract from the main attractions of yesterday's events.
