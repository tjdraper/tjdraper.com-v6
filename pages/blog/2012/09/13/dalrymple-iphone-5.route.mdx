> Iâ€™m happy to report that I was able to operate the iPhone 5 with ease using one hand. That means I was able to reach the top of the screen with my thumb, change options and navigate through the screens without having to reach uncomfortably.

That's good because one thing I can't stand about these bigger phones that I try out in the stores from time to time is the fact that it takes two hands to operate them.
