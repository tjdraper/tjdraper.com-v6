> Western Prince William Del. Bob Marshall, R-13th, says disabled children are God’s punishment to women who have aborted their first pregnancy.
> 
> He made that statement last Thursday at a press conference to oppose state funding for Planned Parenthood.
> 
> “The number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion with handicaps has increased dramatically. Why? Because when you abort the first born of any, nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children,” said Marshall, a Republican.
> 
> “In the Old Testament, the first born of every being, animal and man, was dedicated to the Lord. There’s a special punishment Christians would suggest.”

What is with the wackos and crazies coming out in the pro-life community lately? These are "people" we're talking about here and this does not help the pro-life cause in any way. We do not want to restrict abortion because a disabled child is punishment from God. We want to stop abortion because it is murder, end of story.
