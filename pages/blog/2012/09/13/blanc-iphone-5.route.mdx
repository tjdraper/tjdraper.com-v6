> Earlier this year Tim Cook said Apple was [doubling down on secrecy](http://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-at-d10-2012-5#pm094509), and yet virtually every single thing announced today was called by the rumor mill.

> That is not to say that today’s event was a disappointment. Quite the contrary. The mystery and surprise of today’s announcements may have been diminished, but the quality of the products themselves was not. Knowing about the iPhone 5 before it was announced doesn’t make it any less a device had we not known anything at all.

A good list of items, thoughts, and observations follows that are worth taking the time to read through.
