> The iPhone 3GS has officially been discontinued by Apple, the company confirmed on Thursday, and has been replaced by the iPhone 4 as its free on-contract handset.

> Some industry watchers [had speculated](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/05/21/apples_iphone_3gs_expected_to_live_on_for_under_300_in_developing_markets.html) that Apple could continue to offer the iPhone 3GS in developing markets as a contract-free device. But the company confirmed to _All Things D_ that the iPhone 3GS is [officially discontinued](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/13/allthingsd.com/20120913/iphone-3gs-takes-a-dirt-nap/).

I alwasy thought it was a silly theory that Apple might keep the 3GS as the free phone and kill off the 4. The 3GS was a good phone and it had a great run, but it's starting to get a little long in the tooth. The iPhone 4 on the other hand is still quite a fine phone.
