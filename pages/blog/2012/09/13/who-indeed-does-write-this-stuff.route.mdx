> Writing for Seeking Alpha, Ed Liston warns that [“Apple May Lose The Smartphone War To Google.”](http://seekingalpha.com/article/853071-apple-may-lose-the-smartphone-war-to-google?source=feed)
>
> Needless to say, what Apple is “losing” is just market share. Forget the fact that it makes most of the money and that Google makes more money on mobile advertising from iOS than Android and that Microsoft may have made more off of Android so far than Google. Forget all that! If Android has more market share, Google is winning!

The Macalope's most recent column is good, as usual. But the last bit of the article from which I quoted is particularly relevant to the title. Who on earth does write this garbage?
