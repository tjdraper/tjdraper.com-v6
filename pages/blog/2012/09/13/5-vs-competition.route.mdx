> The iPhone 5 might not be a big departure visually from the previous generation, but Apple is packing a punch with its new smartphone.
>
> The iPhone 5 arrives September 21 and its immediate rival will be the [Galaxy S III](http://www.techhive.com/article/2000501/jelly-bean-to-be-pushed-to-galaxy-s-iii-by-october.html), which Samsung claims to have sold 20 million units of so far. But that's not all; Motorola and Nokia will also launch new flagship phones later in the year, the [Lumia 920](http://www.techhive.com/article/2000442/nokia-lumia-920-vs-the-world-spec-showdown.html) and the [Droid RAZR HD](http://www.techhive.com/article/2000443/hands-on-with-motorolas-latest-droid-razr-smartphones.html).

You look at that line up and tell me which one is the best looking and easiest to use? Apple doesn't play the tech specs game, but the iPhone 5 stacks up pretty well. I know which phone I would buy of these four.
