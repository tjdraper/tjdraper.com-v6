> It’s been a bad week for [_The Verge_](http://www.theverge.com/), the tech news clearinghouse started by former-Engadget staffers last year and part of the growing [Vox Media](http://www.voxmedia.com/) empire. With a slick “magazine-like” layout and loads of ways to interact with the site, the team there has undoubtedly built an incredible online presence. Their video content is second-to-none, their forums are full of informed nerdy-types and their long-form feature pieces look amazing in a Web browser. The trouble is the content itself, which this week proved to be weak, shameful, unconscionable or all of the above. So I’m done with them.
