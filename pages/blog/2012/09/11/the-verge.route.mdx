Almost a year ago now, [Ben Brooks did a take down of The Verge](http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/failure/).

> As I said above I was pretty excited about _The Verge_ and what the crew behind it was trying to do. I think they created a great independent site that gets excellent access to companies they cover. I think that they created a great brand and image.
>
> But I think the site’s content is pretty lackluster.
>
> Push aside the press release re-writes that contain little to no commentary — this is par for the course (unfortunately) — and you are left with tech specs.
>
> When the most interesting thing you write on your site — from a reader’s perspective that reads 300+ tech sites in his RSS reader — is a rebuttal to another site, well I think you have big problems.

At this point I was also a bit disappointed with _The Verge_, but there have been some redeeming qualities — like their video reviews which are top notch. So I didn't give up on them yet.

I've also been a bit irritated by _The Verge_'s editor-in-chief, Josh Topolsky here and there. He tends to be an arrogant moron who really doesn't always know what he's talking about. But I let that slide. Everyone is entitled to their personality.

Things sort of blew up yesterday when [Marco Arment made a passing comment about _The Verge_ in his link post](http://www.marco.org/2012/09/10/elephant):

> Like The Verge, Engadget naturally [made no mention](http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/10/hp-spectre-one-all-in-one-envy-20-envy-23-pavilion-20/) of the HP Spectre One’s many obvious similarities to the iMac.

> Big “gadget” blogs depend on maintaining very friendly relationships with the companies whose products they cover so they can continue to get exclusives, interviews, press badges to events, and early access to products. Maintaining these relationships while retaining credibility isn’t always an easy choice for many sites, and many choose poorly.

This is also one of my irritations with the big tech news outlets of late. They seem to go out of their way to _not_ mention the obvious. I know all the people who hate Apple will accuse all of us on this side of the fence of fanboyism, but really, these examples of which we link to and are talking about are so obvious it's unreal.

So then [Gruber had a theory](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/10/marco-design):

> My theory is that it’s not about access; it’s about not pissing off the vocal anti-Apple contingent of their readerships. Those who claim to truly believe the iPhone is just a black rectangle with round corners.

Previously, [Gruber had also posted](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/30/samsung):

> Serious question for The Verge: how do you run an article about these things without even mentioning that the industrial design is a blatant rip-off of the MacBook Air?
>
> Who has less integrity: Samsung for “designing” this, or The Verge for pretending it’s legitimate?

Well, that didn't sit to well with Topolsky [who tweeted this](https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/statuses/245199223715409920):

> When Marco, or Gruber, or anyone else puts in the work we do in the way that we do it, let me know.

Wow. Talk about arrogant. Look, I know John Gruber and Marco Arment can be arrogant — well you know whats — too, but this is just way over the top. But Topolsky wasn't finished yet. Topolsky [takes to his personal tumblr blog](http://joshuatopolsky.com/post/31285353423/integrity-and-bullies-with-blogs):

> But, just as I felt compelled to respond to Michael Arrington when he attacked the work I (and my team) did at Engadget, I am now responding to Marco Arment, John Gruber, and anyone else who sets up a minimal Wordpress blog and thinks that the ability to publish text onto the internet gives them insight into what journalism is or what I do for a living.

This is neither here, nor there, but I just have to comment on this because it's funny. It's funny that he talks about a minimal WordPress blog when both Gruber and Arment are both well known non-users of WordPress. Gruber [uses Moveable Type](http://daringfireball.net/colophon/), and Arment uses a [static blog publishing engine he custom-built himself](http://www.marco.org/secondcrack).

But moving on.

> Without going down a rabbit hole of he-said she-said, Marco and Gruber are just basically wrong. We of course mention this kind of thing all the time in our writing. Like [here](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/12/3117889/dell-xps-14-review-2012), and [here](http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/4/2677801/hp-envy-15-review-late-2011), for instance — in reviews especially, where that kind of critique is actually useful. Here’s our senior editor Paul Miller [talking about it in 2009](http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/15/hp-envy-13-and-15-bring-luxury-to-the-everyman-look-like-macboo/). You guys getting this over there? Welcome to three years ago. Still not getting it? Here’s us [making fun of Nokia in 2007](http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/29/nokias-iphone-no-seriously/) for an Apple-style design. This is old hat. We mention it plenty, we talk about it on the Vergecast plenty. Nilay and I have been ripping Samsung to shreds over it for years. Gruber and Marco are plainly and simply wrong.

Yes, I think this is actually our point. No one is saying it is never mentioned. But we have all noticed a trend lately that they don't mention it nearly as much as they should or used to. The point is that there is an elephant in the room that is very often overlooked. The lack of journalistic integrity is astounding, actually.

Jonathan Poritsky [had this to say](http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/10/topolsky/):

> I get Topolsky’s knee-jerk reaction in publishing this post, though for the life of me I don’t understand why he took to his personal blog and not _The Verge’s_ forums, let alone publishing an editorial comment on _Verge_ proper.[2](http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/10/topolsky/#fn:2) He has been hurt by two of the tech community’s heaviest hitters, so he’s upset or trying to rally his troops or whatever.

...

> _The Verge_, it seems, is primarily aimed at people who read _The Verge_. You think they don’t mention Apple? They did! Two months ago! Eight months ago too! Listen to The Vergecast. Read the rest of the site. Everything is there.

Yeah. Pretty much.

So, I'm pretty much done with _The Verge_. I've had enough of the drama, nonsense, and lack of journalistic integrity.
