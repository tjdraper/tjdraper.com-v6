> We just release version 1.2 last week in parallel with a Professional License sale and we must say, the flood gates have been opened. The Twitter, followers, new users, feedback, and buzz have jumped to a new level altogether. This makes us very happy because weâ€™ll be better able to make you the developer happy!

Much as I love ExpressionEngine, I think this is the CMS to keep an eye on. I wonder more and more often why we need to store all this stuff in databases. Why can't we store things in flat text files on the server? Statamic is moving that thinking forward. It's very young and doesn't do everything I need to be able to do for most websites yet, but I am definitely keeping up with it.
