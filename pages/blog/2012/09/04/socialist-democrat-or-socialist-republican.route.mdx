> The same forces that put Obama in place have now engineered a choice in the 2012 election intended to force voters to side either with a socialist Democrat who wants to impose socialism on the nation or a socialist Republican who has already imposed socialism on his home state of Massachusetts. To say that voters who refuse to support either are somehow responsible for electing one or the other is like saying that people who refuse to submit to the demands of terrorists are somehow responsible for killing the people the terrorists subsequently murder. The guarantee of successful terrorism that results from that perverse logic places everyone's life in greater danger.

> The responsibility for Obama's victory or loss burdens the people who support him. The responsibility for Romney's victory or loss burdens the people who support him. Forces larger than both of us have engineered the situation in which those who oppose Obama supposedly "have no choice" but to support his all too similar opponent. But where there is no choice, there is no election, only a powerful fabrication intended to force good people to betray all that they profess to believe.

This is very good!
