> The prospect of Mitt Romney winning the White House in November fills Sandra Fluke with fear and pro-lifers with relief. But according to his sister, Mitt Romney will not affect the nation’s abortion laws and certainly will not ban the killing of the unborn if he is elected president.
> 
> Jane Romney, the candidate’s eldest sister, said the feminist fear that a President Romney would restrict abortion-on-demand was “conjured.”
> 
> “He’s not going to be touching any of that,” she said at a “Women for Mitt” event that coincided with the Republican National Convention in Tampa.
> 
> She added that “Mitt’s much more in the middle” on abortion than the GOP platform, which favors informed consent and waiting periods in addition to a Right to Life amendment.
> 
> “It’s not his focus,” Jane said.
