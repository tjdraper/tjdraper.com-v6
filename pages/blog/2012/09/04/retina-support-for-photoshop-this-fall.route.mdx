> The Photoshop and Lightroom teams are pleased to announce we will provide support for HiDPI displays in the coming months, including the Retina Display available on the new MacBook Pro. Supporting this new technology requires significant work by our product teams and we’re committed to provided a free update to all Photoshop CS6 customers this Fall and Lightroom 4 as soon as the work is complete.

Way to server your customers quickly Adobe. Your Pro customers aren’t likely to be interested in this gorgeous display anyway, right?

Procrastinate much?
