> AT&T’s LTE (long term evolution) network is not nearly as broad as Verizon’s. And because of that, the debut of an LTE iPhone could put it at a competitive disadvantage.
> 
> “As of the end of 2Q12, Verizon’s LTE network covered 230 million POPs, more than all the other carriers in the U.S. combined,” Jefferies & Co. analyst Thomas Seitz said in a note to clients. “We believe this network advantage could lead to a share shift towards Verizon, primarily at AT&T’s expense.”

Funny how AT&T was talking about how premature it was of Verizon to be building out it’s LTE network when there were no devices to support the network. Well, looks like it worked out well for them. AT&T could take a lesson or two in how to manage a network from Verizon.
