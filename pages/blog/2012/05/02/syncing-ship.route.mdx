> These days, iTunes is simultaneously Apple’s most important and problematic product. It’s a music and video player. It’s a store, the gateway to buying music, videos, ringtones, and iOS apps. And of course, it’s a syncing system, connecting to Apple devices from iPhone to iPod to Apple TV.

Am I the only one in the world who simply doesn’t have any problems with iTunes and/or syncing?

As a matter of fact, one of the things I have loved about my iPhone from day one is the seamless syncing and ease of management through iTunes.

And these days, with automatic wi-fi syncing, it’s easier than ever. I have a smart playlist that syncs to my iPhone. This smart playlist contains any music in the genre “soundtrack” of which the rating is 3 stars or more. Recently, I added a soundtrack album to iTunes and rated it at 4 stars. Sometime later, I decided I wanted to listen to it in the car, so I brought up the Music app on my iPhone, and started playing it. I never had to verify it was on the iPhone, drag it over, or deal with sync issues. It just worked.

I don’t get what people’s problem is.
