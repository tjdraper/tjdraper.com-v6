See, I don’t think Apple is perfect. In fact this is just downright stupid of Apple. The word that I’m looking for I won’t use here since I try to keep it cleaner than most tech sites.

My friend, [Joey Valenti linked to The Verge’s article on this](http://joeyvalenti.com/archive/dropbox-sdk-ios-apps-rejected) and quoted one of the comments:

> We have a raft of rejections over patently silly hypotheticals. Meanwhile, there was never any chance that existing companies like Amazon were going to give Apple a slice of their revenue stream just because they wanted an app on a phone. So this is a bad policy and Apple should be blasted for it, because it’s a stupid policy, not because it’s an evil policy.

Yeah, pretty much.
