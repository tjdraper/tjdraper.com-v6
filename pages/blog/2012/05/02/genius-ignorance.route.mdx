Does anyone remember when the kinds folks at the Apple Store Genius Bar knew what they were talking about?

> Since the iOS 5.1 update, my iPhone 4S has had terrible battery life. I joked about it being related to the new “4G” label displayed on the phone. That joke stopped being funny to me when I needed to charge my phone three times a day.
> 
> Next, I noticed that the slide to unlock would occasionally stutter. At least once a day I observed app icons randomly displaying a loading progress bar when they were not being updated.

…

> This is what Apple is training their Geniuses to tell people: It’s your fault. You’re using it wrong. Spend an entire day to reset the phone, install all of the apps again. Reconfigure them all. Place them all in folders and on home screens again. Kill your apps.

Two things:

One, how is it possible that of the four iOS devices I have owned, and the multitude of iOS devices that my friends have, I have never once experienced, nor have I seen experienced one of the problems mentioned above. Never once has any iPhone ever offered to stutter on a slide to unlock. iOS 5.1 significantly improved my battery life. I have never EVER had an icon randomly display a loading progress bar unless an update was in progress.

Two, what is going on with the Geniuses? Did Apple have to hire too many too fast after the iOS device explosion and their training process just fell through the cracks? I remember when Geniuses were knowledgeable, extremely helpful, and not stupid. But I have to tell you, if you hear any Apple Genius tell you to kill all your apps in the multi-tasking tray, you should either turn around and walk out, or ask for a Genius who knows what he/she is talking about. iOS is not designed to work that way. Geniuses should know that. That they don’t is shameful.
