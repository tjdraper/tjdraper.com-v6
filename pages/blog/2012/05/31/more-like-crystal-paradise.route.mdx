This analogy doesn’t work on so many levels. But at the most basic level, if it were a prison, you couldn’t leave. No one is stopping anyone from leaving the iOS or OS X garden at any time.

Speaking of rights, I think they have this idea of rights confused, it is the right of Apple to sell a device that does not allow root access, that only installs apps from their app store.

I agreed with EFF when they fought to keep Jailbreaking from being illegal. It is my right to tinker with a device I own in any way I please. It is not Apple’s right to keep me from doing that. It is however, Apple’s right to sell whatever device they see fit, with whatever software restrictions they can place upon it that they see fit.

As for this bill of rights:

> There are four rights that people purchasing computers should enjoy:
> 
> 1.  **Installation of arbitrary applications on the device.** If the user wishes to, they should not be limited to what is included in one particular proprietary “app store.”
>     
> 2.  **Access to the phone OS at the root/superuser/hypervisor/administrator level.** If consumers wish to examine the low-level code that is running in their pockets, to check for invasions of privacy, run the anti-virus software of their choice, join VPNs, install firewalls, or just tinker with their operating systems, phone and device companies have no legitimate basis for preventing this.
>     
> 3.  **The option to install a different OS altogether.** If people want to install Linux on their iPhones, Boot to Gecko on their Windows phones, or just run a different version of Android on their Android phones, the company that sold them the hardware must not prevent them. Using a cryptographic bootloader to defend against malware is a fine idea, but there must be a way to reconfigure this security mechanism to (1) allow an alternative OS to be installed; and (2) to offer the same cryptographic protections for the alternative OS.
>     
> 4.  **Hardware warranties that are clearly independent of software warranties.** Apple denies warranty coverage to users who have jailbroken their iPhones. While nobody is asking Apple to support jailbroken or modified software, it is inexcusable that the company threatens not to cover, say, a faulty screen, if the customer has chosen to modify the software on their device.

Let’s examine this for just a moment.

### Installation of arbitrary applications on the device

We already have that, it’s called jailbreaking, and it is not illegal. We as consumers do not have the right to tell the company how to make the device. We can’t tell them they cannot put security restrictions in place that do not let you install arbitrary applications on the device. We can bypass those restrictions and jailbreak, but we cannot tell Apple how to build their device and software or how to run their operations.

### Access to the phone OS at the root/superuser/hypervisor/administrator level.

See above.

### The option to install a different OS altogether.

See above. It’s been done, it can be done, people will continue to do it if they choose to. Again, I can’t stress enough how it is not up to us to tell Apple how they must build their devices and software.

### Hardware warranties that are clearly independent of software warranties.

This is just ridiculous. Apple is well within their rights to determine what restrictions to put on their warranties. If they won’t honor the warranty because you violated the terms of the warranty they clearly spelled out, that’s their business.

And it’s not completely far fetched to say that software _could_ do physical damage to a device. I can’t think of a good example on an iPhone at the moment, but let’s take a Macintosh. There is firmware built into a Macintosh that controls things at a very low level. One of the things it controls is the fan that keeps things from overheating. Now lets say you hacked into that low level firmware and screwed it up so that the fans don’t come on when they are supposed to… as a result you fry the logic board. I don’t know what Apple’s warranty policy on that would be, but they would be well within their rights to have terms saying if you screw with the firmware of the logic board and it fries you are on your own.

### Conclusion

In short, the EFF seems to think that in order to secure consumer rights, they need to trample other’s rights. Somethings is quite off about that.

I [haven’t always agreed with every decision that Apple has ever made](http://appleuserpro.com/category/apple-stupidity) but I have never, anywhere made claim that Apple doesn’t have the right to do it. As the consumer I can choose to continue buying Apple products, or I can shop elsewhere. That is a little thing we like to call a right. It is our right to do so. It is not our right to impose our view upon Apple. That is a little thing we like to call a violation of someone else’s rights.

As for the Crystal Prison, I think of it more as a Crystal Paradise that I can leave at any time. But I don’t want to. Despite my sometimes irritation with the things Apple does, the benefits far outweigh the irritations. I have said it before, and I will say it again:

I often feel as if with my Apple devices I live in a beautiful garden. Once in a while I find a weed or a badly curated area, but it’s far better than anything else around and so I stay in the garden, free to leave any time I want. The garden is well tended, and I have very few irritations and disagreements with the caretaker of the garden.

Those that live outside the garden will sometimes shout at us from the outside as they toil in the barren desert passing by that we are slaves and in prison. We can’t plant a tree anywhere we want (like say, the middle of the walk way), we can’t plant any kind of bush we want (like say an ugly old bramble bush, or a poisonous plant) and we are therefore slaves to the system.

I usually just shake my head sadly, write a ranting article, and go on about my merry way in my beautiful garden.
