> ’m no Apple hater, and I welcome an Apple device to the (don’t call it a) netbook market, but I’ve got to think this device would be a flop. This concept is such a train wreck from start to finish that I don’t know where to begin.

…

> Since a tablet is designed for lying flat, you have to be looking straight down to view the computer. Actually, that makes it suck for most things. I guess Apple could build in some sort of stand, but that detracts away from the sort of sexy minimalism that it is famous for.

…

> While the iPhone OS might seem like an obvious choice due to its small footprint and contribution toward long battery life, it has glaring limitations on a larger device. A huge audience for a tablet is the artist community, and they need full-fledged OS X to run the apps they’re accustomed to. While Apple certainly has reason to want to build on the success of its App Store, those apps are designed to run on a 3.5-inch screen and most won’t translate very well to something larger.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I’m glad we found out that the Apple Tablet was going to be such a train wreck before it WASN’T. This is just so full of fail it’s almost awesome, and certainly comical.

UPDATE: From some feedback I got, it appeared to be unclear that this is follow-up to PC World “Claim Chowder.” This article I linked to and quoted by PC World was published on July 27, 2009. Apple announced the iPad at a special event on January 27, 2010. They began selling iPads on April 3 2010.

You can note in the categories below that this item is filed in Claim Chowder Follow Up. This means that I’m likely linking to an old item, or missed prediction of some kind and poking major fun at them. And very likely it is or will be because they were calling doom for Apple.
