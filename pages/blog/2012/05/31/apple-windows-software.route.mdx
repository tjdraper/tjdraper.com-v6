I agree. I love iTunes. A lot. I use it every day and can’t imagine why anyone would want anything else. I often wonder why people complain so much about it. Until I have to use the Windows version. Then I realize just how clunky and horrible it is.

In fact, I have to use Windows sometimes. And I have to use Apple’s software on Windows. All of Apple’s software for Windows is horrible. Safari on the Mac is my favorite browser. The end. Safari for Windows is just plain awful. iTunes for the Mac is awesome. iTunes for Windows is wretched. Quicktime for Mac is great. Quicktime for Windows is worse than bad. I don’t have any problems with Apple Software Update on the Mac. Apple Software update for Windows is buggy and slow.

It’s really a little bit odd actually because while I don’t think the best Windows software out there is anywhere near as good as many of the Mac Apps I use every day, there some decent Windows software out there. So I know that better software can be made for Windows. It seems Apple just doesn’t make good Windows software. It’s sort of odd coming from the company whose philosophy is more or less, “Win or go home.”

I don’t know what the answer is, but one thing is for certain. If I’m using Windows, I try to avoid Apple software. It’s pathetic.
