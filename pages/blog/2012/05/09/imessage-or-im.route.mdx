[Dan Moren argues that Apple is missing the boat](http://www.macworld.com/article/1166294/imessage_and_instant_messages_deserve_different_apps.html) by integrating iMessage into it’s renamed IM app previously called iChat, now called Messages.

I really don’t know if it’s possible for me to disagree more. I think some of Apple’s current implementation leaves a little to be desired, but Messages for Mac is currently a beta so I have yet to level full criticism at Apple over implementation details. But Moren really wants two apps. Okay fine. I get that. But I disagree with it.

Here’s the deal. For those that have iMessage whom I communicate with IM style, Gtalk has been replaced by iMessage. We use it for instant message just fine. The implementation detail that bugs me just a little is that 50% of the time, my iPhone buzzes with each message [1](#fn:imessageim1).

But I actually love using iMessage for IM because the full conversation is present and synced on all my devices. I don’t care about status anymore, I haven’t for a long time. I used to fiddle with my away or available status, or tried for a while to have my Gtalk status reflect my Google Buzz status. But after a while, I went to an “always available” model. My phone was always logged in to Gtalk via BeejiveIM, my computer is was always logged in to Gtallk whenever it was on via iChat. If someone messaged me and didn’t get me, well it’s not the end of the world. So the iMessage always available thing doesn’t bother me, I treat it the same as IM: If I’m available and able, I answer, if I’m not I don’t.

And I certainly don’t want to manage two apps. I do still use Gtalk for my PC friends, or for those that are just not comfortable with iMessage but are doing just fine with IM.

And iMessage solves one major problem that I’ve always had with any IM network. IM is a status driven model. I have to log in and be connected to receive messages. But the problem is that I often get logged out of IM networks without knowing it. Gtalk has a stream error, or a transport error or some such nonsense. It was especially challenging for my communication with my wife. iChat would have an error and she wouldn’t see it. So she was often not available via IM and it was frustrating for both of us. Since we went to iMessage, we are able to communicate IM style much more often. And the bonus is she and I both get the messages on our Macs and our iPhones.

So, sorry Dan, but I disagree whole heartedly. I think Ben Brooks [is mostly right in his take on this](http://brooksreview.net/2012/04/imessage-message/).

> It’s an interesting problem, but I don’t think separating the two is the solution. iMessage is great and so is IM, and they are two very different communication methods, BUT one is the future and one is the past.

Where I disagree is when he says that they are two very different communication methods. I have not found that to be the case in practice.

1.  If I’m active in the conversation, the iPhone doesn’t seem to “come alive” with alerts as much because the chat window on the Mac is active and messages are getting marked read immediately. [↩](#fnref:imessageim1)
