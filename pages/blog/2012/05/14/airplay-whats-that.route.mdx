> Glenn A. Britt, the company’s chief executive, said in a group interview on Friday that the challenge for digital video was that there was no simple way to get Internet-based video onto the television screen. He wasn’t familiar with AirPlay.

How is it possible for the CEO of a media company to be so completely out of touch?

> “I’m not sure I know what AirPlay is,” he said, though he noted that he was an enthusiastic Apple customer. “Today we want to be on every screen. Today it’s a little bit clunky to get programming from the Internet onto the TV — not so hard to get it on your iPad.

This is just really astounding.

> What’s hard is the plumbing, what wires do you connect, what device do you use. So the current Apple TV, the little thing, the hockey puck, really doesn’t do anything to help enable you to get Internet material on your TV.”

There are two cables to connect for an Apple TV: the HDMI cable and the Power cable. And what do you mean “…the current Apple TV … really doesn’t do anything to help enable you to get Internet material on your TV.” Have you heard of this thing called Netflix? How about iTunes movies and TV Shows?

They really don’t come any stupider than this folks.
