> - Whoever uses social networks to find content, usually begins the web journey there and goes back naturally. We don’t need to be reminded of what network we use on the way. We know. We came from there.
> - For those who don’t use social networks the social media buttons are completely useless.
> - If readers are too lazy to copy and paste the URL, and write a few words about your content, then it is not because you lack these magical buttons.

> Don’t worry. These buttons will vanish. The previous wave of buttons for Delicious and Digg and Co. vanished, Facebook and Twitter and G+ might vanish or they might survive, but the buttons will vanish for sure. Or do you seriously think that in ten years we will still have those buttons on every page? No, right? Why, because you already know as a user that they’re not that great.

I couldn’t agree more. The only social media buttons on this site are the ones in the header leading you to the main social network page for Apple User Pro. This is intentional. They are only to let you know that an account exists for this website and you can follow that way if you like.

I can’t stand social media clutter on _every article_ on the web that I read. It drives me absolutely nuts.
