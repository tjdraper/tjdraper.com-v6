> Fox is shaping up its 2012-2013 TV season slate, and we now know, we’ll get a Season 2 of “Touch” and saying goodbye to “Alcatraz” and “The Finder,” which have both been canceled.

Wow, talk about canceling the good ones and renewing the horrible one. The Finder was okay, Alcatraz was **awesome**, and Touch is quite possibly one of the worst shows on TV.

Additionally, Bones — which was renewed — is getting long in the tooth and needs to wind down if they can’t restore it to its former glory. It used to be such a great show but it’s really circling the drain.

Glad that Fringe has been renewed. That’s probably the only really good news from Fox. It’s my favorite show right now.
