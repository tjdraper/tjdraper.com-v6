> Late Friday night, Adobe confirmed its plan to issue free patches to fix the problems in all three applications—a reversal of its previous strategy that would have forced users to pay for a CS6 upgrade in order to rectify the problems.

That’s nice, but I think you guys already tipped your hand. Still, I won’t complain too loudly. Adobe heard the outcry against it’s stupid decision to not patch this vulnerability, and reversed that decision.

Of course it’s hard to take something back once it’s out there, but good for them for doing the right thing in the end.
