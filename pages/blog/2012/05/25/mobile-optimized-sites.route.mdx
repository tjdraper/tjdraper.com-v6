> One thing that really bugs me is when I encounter an ‘mobile optimized’ website on my iPhone/iPad. I hate these sites because they are akin to going into a Ferrari dealership to see a Ferrari and instead only getting to see a Mercedes, that some guy traded in — you feel screwed over.

In general, I agree with this sentiment. However, there are challenges with just serving the standard site to a mobile device. I find standard websites on my phone just as annoying as mobile websites that suck.

I think that designers should work very hard to make the website function for mobile as well as on the desktop. Forgive me for tooting my own horn, but I personally think I have done it correctly on this site. I serve the exact same HTML for mobile devices that I do for desktop browsers. I serve a mobile styleheet to mobile devices such as the iPhone. I serve the desktop styleheet to iPads. There aren’t a huge amount of differences between the mobile and the desktop stylesheets. And all the functionality is exactly the same.

I think it’s just really lame to reduce functionality for mobile browsers, or to constantly bug users about downloading an app.
