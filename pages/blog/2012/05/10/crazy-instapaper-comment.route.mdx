> Marco is actually a part of the Apple cult along with Gruber and the rest of them. These guys have no idea what actual software development is actually like. For this you truly need to look beyond the closed box that is Objective-C, Cocoa, and look out into the world of real languages. These guys won’t have the mindset to code natively in C/C++, for widely adopted frameworks such as .NET, utilizing modern languages like C#. They will not be able to write cross platform code using Java, and hence their inherent hate for Android (of course that is just a side reason for hating, we all know what the real reasons are).

Uhh, yeah whatever.

> Due to this lack of ability to comprehend development at a mature level they will onot be able to really do any web development using things such as PHP …

I love that this comment reveals how ignorant the commenter really is since much of Instapaper’s service is built with PHP.

Here’s Marco:

> I’ve never visited the Core Data hand-holding playground, but it sounds fun. Instead, the Instapaper app’s database layer is written directly against SQLite’s C API. The server-side code is all in PHP, and before moving to the sugar coated painted kingdom, I spent 4 years writing the PHP back-end code to a [little site](http://www.tumblr.com/) to handle thousands of dynamic requests per second.

Tumblr is such a little site.

I’m not sure what world the commenter that Marco linked to is living in where developing for iOS is not “writing for real life daily use platforms, who develop functionality for the user” but I hope he likes it in that strange world. The rest of us in the real world will enjoy Instapaper.

Marco, if you read this (which I doubt), you were obviously a little bothered by this guy since you linked to him. Well, ignore him. I love Instapaper. So do a lot of other people. Pay no attention to this troll. Keep developing the awesome Instapaper app/service. I’ll keep paying for it and enjoying it.
