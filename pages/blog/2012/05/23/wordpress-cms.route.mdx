> WordPress was first for pure blogging, then became embraced as a CMS (though some people still deny this), is seeing growth and innovation in being used as an application platform (I think we’re about a third of the way through that), and just now starting to embrace social and mobile — the fourth phase of our evolution.
>
> As with each of our previous transitions there are large, established, and seemingly unshakable competitors entrenched in the same space. This is good because we can learn from those that came before, as we always have, and good competitors drive you to be better. As before, people will probably not notice what we’re doing at first, or deny it’s happening as folks who still say WordPress “isn’t a CMS.”

Put me in the denial camp please. Well actually, I think it is more consistent to say that WordPress has become a CMS, just not a very good one. WordPress is fine if you want to apply a ready-made template at it and call it a day. It’s fine for blogging and having a few pages. It’s not fine as a fully baked CMS.

It simply amazes me how inferior products can get so much traffic in the market. Windows is a prime example of this. WordPress is the Windows of the CMS world.
