Apparently, no one over there does. Or more likely weren’t even smart enough to realize they needed to.

Also, as mentioned at the very end of the linked article, have a look at the [Terms & Conditions page](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/axis/en-us/). Talk about embarrassing on launch. I’m sure they will correct is soon (wait, am I sure?) so I captured a screenshot:

[![Axis terms conditions 560](http://appleuserpro.com/assets/uploads/axis-terms-conditions-560.jpg "axis-terms-conditions-560.jpg")](http://appleuserpro.com/assets/uploads/axis-terms-conditions-full.jpg)

Boy they sure got there act together for this launch. The attention to detail is astounding.
