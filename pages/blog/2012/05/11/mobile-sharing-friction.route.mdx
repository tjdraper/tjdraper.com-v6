So I’ve really been trying to get myself set up so that I can write posts and share links on Apple User Pro from my iPhone. I found this awesome ExpressionEngine [control panel theme/add-on](http://www.putyourlightson.net/responsive-cp) that makes the CP work much better on my iPhone. [1](#fn:sharing1) So that’s great, posting from my iPhone was always a pain just from the CP standpoint until I found that add-on.

But one thing that is really hard from my iPhone to this day is getting the link from the article or linked list item to go to the three social media sites I have selected to use for Apple User Pro. I know that a lot of folks follow sites that way, and I have some followers on each medium. I do not have an automated system in place to share to these social media sites whenever a new article is posted for a variety of reason:

1.  No service or add-on that does this, does it in a satisfactory way. They always, **always** mangle something, or don’t post links they way the are intended to be posted etc.

2.  I am not a developer of anything other than pure HTML/CSS and ExpressionEngine template tags so I can’t write my own add-on or script to automate the process.


On the desktop, it’s not all that hard to share to these three places every time I post. It takes a maximum of 60 seconds.

But it turns out that for Facebook and Google Plus, sharing a link in the intended way is not easy on mobile. In fact, for Google Plus is actually impossible to share a link to your page at all. Let me explain. In order to access a Google Plus page, you have to go to Google Plus, click on the pages tab on the left side, switch to your page, click on the link icon in the sharing area, paste in your link, and then click share.

The mobile app offers no way to manage a Google Plus Page.

Let that sink in for a minute.

Yeah… isn’t that crazy?

But it gets better. When you visit Google Plus from a mobile browser, you cannot access your Google Plus pages from the mobile version of the site and there is no obvious way to get to the desktop version of Google Plus.

So I tried an app I have called [Dolphin](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dolphin-browser/id452204407). It has a setting/mode that allows you to force a site to serve it’s desktop version. And at first I thought that was going to be the way to make it work. It does work very slowly, scrolling and zooming are choppy etc. But I thought I could put up with it long enough to get the link posted. But there’s a problem, overtime I try click in the sharing field to type or paste something, the browser locks up and then crashes.

So, Google Plus pages cannot be accessed at all for sharing on an iPhone.

The Dolphin method actually does work for Facebook, although the full desktop version runs painfully slow. But it does work.

Twitter of course is actually the easiest. There is no official method for sharing a link, just paste and post.

But I did actually find a way to make Facebook and Twitter sharing extremely easy on my iPhone. Although I hate social media sharing buttons on articles and posts with a fiery burning passion, it does actually work better for mobile (at least on Facebook). I use Dolphin to force Desktop mode, and I have my site set up to only show the social media buttons to me if I’m logged in to ExpressionEngine (I don’t want anyone else to see them because I threw them in haphazard and I hate social media sharing buttons on posts anyway). Well as it turns out for Google Plus there is (again) no way to use that to share to your page (huh?), only to your personal Google Plus account. Are you noticing a pattern here with Google? Even though they are pushing Google Plus **hard** their implementation is still half backed and trashy.

As long as you are forcing desktop mode this actually does work quite well for Facebook. If you are not forcing desktop mode, there is no way to share to your Facebook Page, only to your personal timeline.

And for Twitter, it just makes things that much easier. Click, share, done.

So, Twitter gets an A+ in all this. Couldn’t be easier.

Facebook gets a C. That you can’t share to your page from Mobile is stupid.

Google Plus gets an F. Is there a grade lower than F? F-? Whatever, they get negative points.

So what’s the deal? It’s not like this mobile thing is just a passing fad, it’s here to stay in a big way. Why are Facebook, and more especially Google Plus so hostile to Mobile in these ways? I don’t get it.
