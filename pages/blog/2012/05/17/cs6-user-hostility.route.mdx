> I still don’t understand why I, as a user, have to see folders called “deploy,” “packages,” and “payloads” in addition to the installer app icon, with all kinds of folders and subfolders inside them, but this is clearly something to which Adobe is very attached, and there is only so many times you can ask the same question before you start wondering whether anyone actually cares about such “details.”

…

> One day, maybe, an Adobe engineer will understand that, when the user has to go through a lengthy installation process, the best approach is to let him enter all the required information (password, serial number, etc.) right away, and then — and only then — go through all the lengthy processes that are of no interest to him without asking for any user input, so that he can switch to something else and, you know, actually make valuable use of his time.

I do not yet have CS6, but it looks like all the stupidness is still there for the install process at least. Every complaint in this article is the same as I have had with CS5.

Also, on the icons, is it just me or are Adobe’s icons and splash screens just getting stupider and stupider?
