> Today, we’ve been informed that Apple has removed Airfoil Speakers Touch from the iOS App Store.1 We first heard from Apple about this decision two days ago, and we’ve been discussing the pending removal with them since then. However, we still do not yet have a clear answer on why Apple has chosen to remove Airfoil Speakers Touch. Needless to say, we’re quite disappointed with their decision, and we’re working hard to once again make the application available for you, our users.

This is really, REALLY uncool. Apple may not have many weaknesses (as far as I’m concerned) but the ones they do have are whoppers. And their communication skills with third party developers may be one of the biggest whoppers of a weakness that they have. That, coupled with the screws of the App Store being just a little too tight and it makes for a really bad developer experience.
