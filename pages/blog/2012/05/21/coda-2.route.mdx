> We made Coda 2 better at everything. So it can make you better at everything.

> You code the web. We revolutionized that process in Coda, putting everything in one place. An editor. Terminal. CSS. Files. But we knew we could do better. With Coda 2, we went beyond expectations. With loads of new, much-requested features, a few surprises, and a seriously refreshed UI, this update is, truly, major.

Describing me as excited hardly seems to do justice to my state of mind about this update!
