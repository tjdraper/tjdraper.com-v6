> By this I mean that if you want to create extensible and maintainable, flexible and predictable websites, you should really take care to make your CSS selectors as dev-friendly as possible; i.e. short.

I have personally been going more and more towards shorter and more generic selectors in my CSS, and most of the stuff here makes a lot of sense to me. Too many children and dependencies makes for messier and less efficient coding.

And as for IDs or Classes, I donâ€™t believe I used a single ID selector in my CSS on the last site I did.
