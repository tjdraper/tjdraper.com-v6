> The command that had been run was most likely ‘rm -r -f \*’, which—roughly speaking—commands the system to begin removing every file below the current directory. This is commonly used to clear out a subset of unwanted files. Unfortunately, someone on the system had run the command at the root level of the Toy Story 2 project and the system was recursively tracking down through the file structure and deleting its way out like a worm eating its way out from the core of an apple.

They bought the team Pizza that weekend, got them anything they wanted and were generally supportive.

Quite a story. It’s truly amazing that we got a Toy Story 2, and more amazing is that, if anything, it was a better film than Toy Story. It does seem like all great stuff has some sort of horror story somewhere to tell, and this is a big one. And of course then to have to re-do the film after having lost it, recovered it, and worked on it some more. Just amazing.

And I’ve gotta tell you, the “rm” command strikes fear into my heart every time I use it (and I only ever use it over SSH to my server). Things can get really bad really fast if you “rm” the wrong thing.
