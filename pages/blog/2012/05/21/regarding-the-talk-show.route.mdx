> Dan Benjamin shares his thoughts about The Talk Show.

Someone here has class, and [someone does not](https://twitter.com/#!/gruber/status/203698906931015682).

Dan seemed to have been somewhat taken by surprise, sad and disappointed And he wanted to give fans of The Talk Show what they deserved, closure, maybe even amiably point folks to the new podcast (called, by the way, the same name, which never should have happened). Instead, Gruber managed to tick a lot of Talk Show and 5by5 fans off (including me). And even though Dan here helped to cool things down I still won’t be following John Gruber and his new podcast on Mule Radio. In fact, as nasty as Mike Monteiro has been about the whole thing, I won’t be listening to any Mule Radio shows. Ever.

I’m one person, and it may not make a difference, but then again, maybe it will. There seemed to be a lot of unhappy folks on Twitter. There’s a right way to treat your fan base and there’s a wrong way.
