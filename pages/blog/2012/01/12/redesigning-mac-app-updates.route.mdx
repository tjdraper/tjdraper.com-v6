> There are basically two different approaches Mac apps use when it comes to updating. The apps available on the Mac App Store are updated through the Store only – which obviously means that you aren’t really notified of new updates unless you open the App Store. Then, there are apps that aren’t yet available on the App Store for various reasons. Most of these use Sparkle, a free software update framework. It does notify you when you start the app and an update is available – but I believe it’s far to obtrusive. I can at least say for myself that I’m annoyed pretty often when I just want to do something quick with an app and this update window pops up.

> So, I set out to do a redesign of the updating UI on the Mac. I believe this would be a very useful change both as an addition to updating through the App Store as well as a replacement for Sparkle. To illustrate my idea, I’ve used a screenshot of the great app Kickoff designed by Benjamin De Cock.

Yes please! This would solve the problem that the [Sparrow Team was trying to solve](/blog/2011/12/05/sparrow-rejected-because-it-notifies-users-when-theres-an-update) (and which ultimately caused them to get rejected and re-submit the app update without that feature).
