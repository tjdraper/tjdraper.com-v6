> Neoconservatism is a variant of the political ideology of conservatism which rejects the utopianism and egalitarianism of modern liberalism but sees a role for the welfare state. Their main emphasis since 1990 has been using American power to foster democracy abroad, especially in the Middle East. They were notably visible in Republican administrations of George H.W. Bush (1989-93) and George W. Bush (2001-2009).

I donâ€™t have time to read that whole thing right now, but that first paragraph sounds just about right.

So, in case I need to spell it out for you: Neoconservatism = VERY BAD!
