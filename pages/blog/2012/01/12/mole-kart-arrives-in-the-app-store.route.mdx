> Mole Kart has arrived in the App Store and if you are looking for a game that resembles the original Nintendo Mario Kart, you need look no further. After Nintendo sees how this game looks and plays, we are sure it will be talking with its legal team.

This looks like an “oops” by an Apple app reviewer to me. As much as I love Mario Kart, I’m going to wait and see how this plays out. I love Mario Kart and would rather support Nintendo, not this rip-off version.
