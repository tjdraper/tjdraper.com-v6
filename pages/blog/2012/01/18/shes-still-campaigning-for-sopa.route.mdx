I was saddened to see Marsha Blackburn is still campaigning for SOPA. This is of course the [big](https://www.google.com/) [day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) of [protest](http://arstechnica.com/staff/palatine/2012/01/sopa-resistance-day-begins-at-ars.ars). And Marsha chooses to continue campaigning for this reprehensible legislation.

I am reminded of what Mark Twain said:

> Politicians are like diapers; they need to be changed often and for the same reason.

I think Marsha Blackburn is at that point…
