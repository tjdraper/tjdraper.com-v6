> The HTTP Archive charted the growth of the average web page and found that average web pages have grown from 726 KB a year ago to 965 KB now. The 33 percent jump is due in large part to more images and third-party scripts like ads and analytics. Javascript content, spurred on by the rise of HTML5, has grown over the last year by 44.7 percent, according to analysis by Royal Pingdom.

This is stupid. Web pages, in general, should not be this large, I don’t care if faster internet is becoming more and more common.

Just before posting this, I measure the homepage of Apple User Pro. It weighed in at a total of 54796 Bytes. That’s 53.51172 Kilobytes, or 0.05226 Megabytes. You will notice that most of the time this site loads _really_ quickly [1](#fn:avpage1) . This despite the fact that I’m using super budget shared hosting. Optimization has been my goal for a little while now, and I hope we are starting to see a push toward more optimized experience on webpages of all types.

1.  Sometimes the site doesn’t load as quickly. This is because my super budget shared hosting doesn’t always have the greatest database performance. I’m cacheing SQL queries, channel tags, templates, and pretty much anything else I can and have the expiration on the cache set really high; 24 hrs. But anytime I submit a Channel Entry, the cache is cleared, so the initial load must be from the database. Sometimes database performance on this server is great, other times, well, not so much.
