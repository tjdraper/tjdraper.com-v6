> There are five sections to this video demonstrating:
> 
> -   An app going from active to background to suspended
> -   Instacast HD requesting extra background time to finish a podcast download
> -   TomTom running indefinitely in the background
> -   Batman Arkham City Lockdown and Real Racing 2 HD competing for big chunks of device memory
> -   Batman Arkham City Lockdown forcing several smaller apps out of memory
