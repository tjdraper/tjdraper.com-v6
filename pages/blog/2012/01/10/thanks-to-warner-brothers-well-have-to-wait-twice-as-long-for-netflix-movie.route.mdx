> AllThingsD reports that Netflix (and Blockbuster) will be required to wait twice as long, or a full 56 days after DVDs hit retail shelves, before offering Warner Brothers content under a new distribution agreement.

Everything that is wrong with the film and movie industry right there.

But I really believe this anti-consumer mentality is eventually going to come back to bite these big media companies.

Also, love this:

> Hollywood is once again on the wrong side of history and common sense. Rapid availability and fair pricing is what boosts sales. iTunes taught that to music studios ravaged by Napster and the like a decade ago. Steve Jobs told them at the time their competition was free-as-in-file-sharing. Is Hollywood really this intent on making the recording labels seem like geniuses by comparison?

> Here’s once again hoping the old-guard gets replaced soon.
