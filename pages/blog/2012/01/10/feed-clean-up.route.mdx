I did it. I took the plunge. I removed two feeds from my RSS subscriptions; feeds I used to consider vital to my health and well being.

For the last little while I’ve noticed with these particular feeds I tend to scroll on past the 30 or so (each) that have accumulated in the last hour and mark them all as read. So this morning, I had enough. I was up past midnight last night, and the last thing I did was check my RSS feeds and mark them all as read. This morning I had over 100 new items, many of them useless garbage from these feeds. So I removed them. They had turned into just that much more clutter I don’t need hanging around.

I wonder if you can guess which two sites’ feeds I have removed?

Well here they are.

1.  TechCrunch
2.  Engadget

And so I wondered, what happened to these two sites? They used to be great. What made them so garbagey? I can’t say for sure but they do both have one thing in common. They were both scooped up by AOL…
