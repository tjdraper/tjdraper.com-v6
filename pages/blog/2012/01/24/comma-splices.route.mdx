> Except under extraordinarily rare circumstances — unless you’re Charles Dickens, for instance — you can’t use a comma to separate two independent clauses.

I’ve had this sitting in [ReadNow](http://mischneider.net/readnowapp/) for quite some time; mostly to remind myself about the principle every time I see it in my reading list.

I’m not a great writer, but I’m trying to become one. For instance, he says:

> So you’ve mastered it’s vs. its — and you try not to use dashes too much. You’ve learned that the passive voice has its uses; you’ve learned how to build sentences and paragraphs with parallel construction; you’ve learned to use the Oxford comma.
> 
> You’re aces in my book.

I’ve at least got one of those things on the list down: it’s vs. its. I mastered that one some time ago. Also, too vs. to. I’m still working on parallel construction. I do have an opinion on the Oxford comma (which I plan to get to in a later posting). I’m not sure whether it’s right or wrong, and perhaps it’s subjective, but I have an opinion.

And finally,

> Bad:
> 
> -   Comma splices are bad, you shouldn’t use them.
> 
> Good:
> 
> -   Comma splices are bad. You shouldn’t use them.
> 
> Also acceptable:
> 
> -   Comma splices are bad; you shouldn’t use them.
> -   Comma splices are bad — you shouldn’t use them.
> -   Comma splices are bad and you shouldn’t use them.
> -   Comma splices are bad, my dear Mr. Chalmesworthy; hence it prevails upon us all to use Providence as our guide and eschew their use, as we heartily eschew all mortal sins.

I’m working on it. I agree in principle, but I find myself using comma splices where I shouldn’t. This is the rule. This is part of that readability/usability business I’ve been talking about. Not many people seem to care about mastering this and it’s a shame.
