I love my [Magic Mouse](http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/). When I find myself without it for some reason — maybe I’ve left it at home, or maybe I came home and left it at work — I am far less productive. Other mice (even Apple’s old [Mighty Mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Mighty_Mouse), which was previously my primary mouse) just don’t feel right to me anymore.

However, one thing I’ve noticed: there seems to be a buildup of a strange rough film on the top surface of the Magic Mouse. I usually have to clean the surface every couple of days. I’ve never had this problem with any other mouse so I suppose it must be something about the smooth glass surface. And perhaps it’s just my hands, I don’t know.

In any event, I have found that not many cleaners will remove the film. Water certainly won’t do it. Glass cleaner will do it after a fashion. But the best thing by far that I’ve found to remove the film is a cloth dampened with a bit of rubbing alcohol. That seems to make the surface of the mouse silky smooth again for the next couple of days.
