This is a serious aggravation for me. I experience the same thing with many apps. Facebook is actually one of thew worst offenders. Basically, the Facebook iPhone app is a wrapper, and the bulk of the app’s experience is delivered via HTML 5. This make the app unnecessarily slow. More native code, less server side code would be better.
