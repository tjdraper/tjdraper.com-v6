I’m getting really tired of seeing this message when I’m not on my home network.

I have been fairly pleased with the setup until Lion. My computer is almost always on my home network overnight, and via [TimeMachineScheduler](http://klieme.com/TimeMachineScheduler.html) (an app which let’s you change Time Machine’s backup schedule), my computer backs up to my Apple Time Capsule overnight while I’m asleep. It’s a nice system, effortless. I did the initial setup and now I don’t think about it anymore…

Except for that doggone notification about not being able to connect to my Time Capsule. Well of course the Time Capsule isn’t available, I’m not at home on the network where the Time Capsule exists. I have only been receiving this notification since upgrading to Lion, I never received this notification with Snow Leopard or Leopard (the first system to come with Time Machine). A Google search reveals that this does indeed seem to be a Lion issue. And my guess is that, of course this only affects us Laptop users because most other systems that back up to a Time Capsule are always on the network with that Time Capsule. But portables… well, they get around and are often off of the home base network.

It’s really more annoying than anything; it doesn’t blow anything up or make it unusable. I’ll be working away, and all the sudden this notification pops up and takes focus and has to be dismissed. And for me it always comes up twice. After dismissing it the first time, it pops up again in about 5 to 8 seconds.

Here’s to hoping Apple cures this ailment in the next point update.
