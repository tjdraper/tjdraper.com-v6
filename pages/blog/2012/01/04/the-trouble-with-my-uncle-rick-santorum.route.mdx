As we ponder the results of the goings on in Iowa, here’s something else to ponder.

> If you want another big-government politician who supports the status quo to run our country, you should vote for my uncle, Rick Santorum.

…

> Another important reason I support Ron Paul is his position on foreign policy. He is the only candidate willing to bring our troops home, not only from the Middle East, but from around the world.
> 
> Ron Paul seems to be the only candidate trying to win the election for a reason other than simply winning the election.

Listen to the man!
