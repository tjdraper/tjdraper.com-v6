I think this is actually part of the site readability and usability discussion that I’ve been talking a little about.

Comments create entitlement problems, as well as seemingly removing the filter that normally exists between the brain and the mouth (or fingers in this case). You know what that filter is. Every time there’s something you want to say that isn’t nice, and you say to yourself, “you know, I probably shouldn’t say that” and so you don’t. That’s the filter I’m talking about. Well, that filter is seemingly completely absent for most people when posting a comment.

I have also witnessed a bizarre entitlement problem with comment posters where they think they are entitled to post comments on someone else’s site, and if you don’t let them, you are somehow violating their right to free speech. This was most prominently witnessed once a while back when TechCrunch turned off comments for an entire weekend because the mud flinging got so bad. It’s crazy what happens to someone’s communication skills when they are presented with a comment submission form on the internet.

In short, comments are not worth the time or effort. I never bother to read them on other sites anymore, and they attract the wrong sort of people. If you have something to say, publish it, email it, think about it. But don’t waste your time with comments
