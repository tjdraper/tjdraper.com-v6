> It used to be that the most recent notification – be it a text, a timer, or a Facebook alert – would dictate where you’d end up after Sliding to Unlock. That’s actually still the case in iOS 5, but you now also have the option of sliding across an icon (the ones just under the lock screen clock) to home in on a specific notification. In the screenshot above I have the choice of unlocking the phone to see my text or my Due timer.

Being the geek that I am, I already knew this. But I find myself surprised sometimes at people who don’t know this. So here you go. If you didn’t know about this, I have just made your day.
