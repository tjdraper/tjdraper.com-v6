So by now you’ve probably noticed the home page (and the RSS feed) filled up with something called favorites. Well, I’ve started a new section called, what else, Favorites. I’ll be posting my favorite websites there, and I wanted them to show up on the home page (and in the RSS feed) as I add them. Since I started off with an initial list, that list showed up all at once. I’ll be adding more going forward I’m sure.

Visit the favorites page: [Favorites](/favorites)
