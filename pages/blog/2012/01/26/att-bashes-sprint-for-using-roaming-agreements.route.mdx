> AT&T’s Senior Vice President-Federal Regulatory and Chief Privacy Officer Bob Quinn recently wrote a post on the company’s blog that called Sprint out for deciding to use roaming agreements, and “disinvesting” in its own network in Kansas and Oklahoma instead of providing customers with access to its network.

Oh yeah, because AT&T is the very model of a robust network that doesn’t rely on roaming agreements as it’s subscribers travel…

Oh… wait…

> I mean, at AT&T we have spent a lot of time and money investing in recent years racing to keep up with our subscribers’ surging broadband demands precisely because those demands are growing so rapidly

hahahahahahahahahahahaha

I love this response from Sprint

> AT&T, for its part has more unused spectrum than any other carrier in the country. They’ve also under invested in the AT&T network on a per subscriber basis when compared to the rest of the industry by a wide margin. That’s what makes the criticism from AT&T’s lobbyist especially rich.

As far as I’m concerned, Sprint can make whatever business agreements it wants with other carriers and AT&T can just shut up!
