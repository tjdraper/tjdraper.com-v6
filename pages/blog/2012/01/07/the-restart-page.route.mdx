This is absolutely awesome!

The Windows 2000 restart brings back some dusty memories. My first computer came with Windows XP when said OS was brand new, and more than a little buggy. I got that first computer for the express purpose of recording songs that I wrote (I fancied myself a musician and guitarist at the time) and XP just wasn’t stable enough. I didn’t know much about computers then, and a friend of mine got me set up with Windows 2000, which as my memory recalls has probably been to this day one of the most stable releases of the NT line of Windows Operating systems.

Anyway, this page is lots of fun.
