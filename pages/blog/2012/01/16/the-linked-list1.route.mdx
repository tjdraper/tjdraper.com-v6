On my personal site, I received some questions about how a Linked List works. “Where’s the source for the quote you pulled” etc. I’ve been doing The Linked List for much longer here than on my personal site, but I thought I could post here too about how it works. Not a lot of people run Linked Lists this way, [1](#fn:linkedlist1) but I love it because I don’t often have time to write full blown articles, but I find interesting stuff I want to link to and provide a little bit of commentary. The Linked List is a great way for me to do this.

When I post a Linked List item, you will see an arrow at the beginning of the article title. This is the indicator that it is a linked list item, linking to another article on the internet. If you click the title, it will take you there.

If you are reading via RSS feed, a linked list item will link directly to the linked material instead of here to my site. If you wish to link back to the Linked List item on my site, at the end of the RSS item will be a permalink to the Linked List item.
