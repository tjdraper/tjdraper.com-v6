A couple of folks have asked me about The Linked List indirectly. Questions such as where the quote I pulled on post “x” came from. These are usually Linked List items, which is something I’ve only just started doing on this site, but something I’ve been doing for a while on [Apple User Pro](http://appleuserpro.com). It’s not an original idea of mine, I actually first became aware of this approach through [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/). Much of John Gruber’s content there is from his Linked List, where he will link to something, quote a portion of it and provide commentary.

I love this because I don’t often have time to write full blown articles, but I find interesting stuff I want to link to and provide a little bit of commentary. The Linked List is a great way for me to do this. So how does it work?

If the item I have posted is a Linked List item, you will see at the very beginning of the article a link with an arrow next to it like this:

[→ Linked List Link](#)

And below I will often pull a quote from the link and/or provide some commentary.

If you are reading via RSS feed, a linked list item will link directly to the linked material instead of here to my site. At the end of the RSS item will be a permalink to the Linked List item on this site that looks like this:

#### [∞](#)

And that’s how The Linked List works.
