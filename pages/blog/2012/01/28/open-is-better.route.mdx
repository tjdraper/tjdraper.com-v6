> The largest-ever Android malware campaign may have duped as many as 5 million users into downloading infected apps **from Google’s Android Market**, Symantec said today.

_emphasis mine_

But in defense of Google, Symantec has been known to greatly exaggerate the state of malware on platforms before. To hear them tell it, OS X is practically crawling with malware. To date, there are something like 5 trojans on for the Mac — I don’t have the exact figures, lets be really generous and say it’s under 100, because it is — and **no known viruses** for OS X. None. And as of right now, the trojans available won’t even install on current versions of Snow Leopard or Lion. And even if you have an older, out of date system, you must provide and administrator password to install the trojans out there. Because of the way OS X is designed, malware would have a very hard time doing any actual damage without an administrator password. I will not say it is impossible, but it is unlikely.

And iOS has **no known malware** of **any kind.**
