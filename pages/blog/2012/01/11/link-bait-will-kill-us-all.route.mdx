> I’m tired of the same old tech news. Aren’t you? You visit a top-recommended tech-related website to find that 50% or more of their content is link bait. Seriously, Gizmodo? Mashable? I expect more from the tech aficianados. For one thing, they are on the bleeding edge of technology and claim to know how gadgets ought to be used. Why aren’t they providing tech expert insights into practical workflows utilizing gadgets? Why are they dribling on about the abstracts of using social networking platforms without offering first hand accounts of tech on the field?

Yep.
