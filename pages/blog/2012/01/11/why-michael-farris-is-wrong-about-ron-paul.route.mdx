> I just came across [this particular Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150676931144622&id=535184621) post from Michael Farris of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) and Patrick Henry College. It doesn’t surprise me at all given his previous posts regarding his belief that Ron Paul is dangerous and unsuitable for the presidency. While he has done great things for homeschooling in this country, Farris is someone who believes that Lincoln was justified in his position and actions against the southern states before and during the Civil War (which seems difficult to comprehend in light of the way Lincoln trashed the Constitution, judicial system, due process, and the 10th Amendment during his presidency). I say this based on personal correspondence that my dad had with him a few years back, along with his own published writings. But lest you think I am only trying to kill the messenger, let’s look at his argument.

This is a good read and take on the situation.
