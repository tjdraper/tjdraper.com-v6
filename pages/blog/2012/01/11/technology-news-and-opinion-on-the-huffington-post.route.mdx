So I’ve been cleaning out my RSS feeds a little here and there as I have time. And I came across the feed for Switched.com. It’s not like I was ever their biggest fan or anything, but it occurred to me that I hadn’t seen any feeds from them in a while. So I went to switched.com and was redirected the huffingtonpost.com/tech/. Then I remembered that AOL closed them down.

But the thing that struck me about huffingtonpost.com: it’s one of the ugliest sites I’ve ever seen. And so much garbage splattered all over the page. I was not inclined to read anything on that site. It was such an information overload that I just closed the browser.

I sure hope that we continue to see a trend for sites this cluttered and ugly to just go away!
