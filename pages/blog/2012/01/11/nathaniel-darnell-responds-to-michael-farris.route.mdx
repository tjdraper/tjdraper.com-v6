> So it’s with grief that I am compelled to humbly but firmly publicly address your recent post publicly criticizing Congressman Paul’s positions on the 10th and 14th Amendment. Your post asserted that without SCOTUS’s faulty 14th Amendment jurisprudence—one that has opened the door to abortion and sodomy and a host of other evils—we would not have the right to homeschool. This is simply not true.

Nathaniel Darnell’s response to Michael Farris. Nathaniel has a law degree, and he knows what he’s talking about.
