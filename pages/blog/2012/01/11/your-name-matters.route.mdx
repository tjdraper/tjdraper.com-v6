> Take a look at your weblog. How easy is it to find your name?

When I redesign Apple User Pro (and you can be certain I will), I think I’ll be sure my name is part of the design somewhere. Somewhere you can see it on the home page at least. It’s not like it’s hard to find, just click “colophon”, but I do think it’s important for people to stand behind their work.
