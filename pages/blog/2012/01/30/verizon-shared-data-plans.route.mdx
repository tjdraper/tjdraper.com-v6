> Verizon said it was working on a shared data solution for 2012, and according to an anonymous tipster, the new packages could be rolling out soon. We’ve been told that training material for an update to the outfit’s internal account management application includes screenshots (one of which you can see above) that show a new section labeled “account level data plans.” The new section apparently shows an account level charge for data allowance and a 9.99 charge per line.

If they do this in such a way as to save me money, count me in! It makes so much sense to me. My wife and I could both use the same 2GB data plan for an extra 9.99 instead of the $15.00 I’m paying AT&T currently for her data plan.

The only reason I’m not with Verizon was because I would have to pay $30.00 for a data plan for both my phone _and_ my wife’s phone. No deal! This could fix that. But I have a little over 1 1/2 years before I could switch without contract penalty… so we’ll see what happens in that period of time.
