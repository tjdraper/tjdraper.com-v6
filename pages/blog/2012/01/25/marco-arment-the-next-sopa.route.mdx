I suspect that Marco and I would disagree vehemently on most political issues. But wow does he get it right here:

> Such ridiculous, destructive bills should never even pass committee review, but we’re not addressing the real problem: the MPAA’s buying power in Congress. This is a campaign finance problem.

And:

> The MPAA studios hate us. They hate us with region locks and unskippable screens and encryption and criminalization of fair use. They see us as stupid eyeballs with wallets, and they are entitled to a constant stream of our money. They despise us, and they certainly don’t respect us.

The only problem I have with his article is this:

> So maybe, instead of waiting for the MPAA’s next law and changing our Twitter avatars for a few days in protest, it would be more productive to significantly reduce or eliminate our support of the MPAA member companies starting today, and start supporting campaign finance reform.

Much easier said than done. I know I don’t want to do that. It would mean I can’t watch great movies like _Batman Begins_ or _The Dark Knight_ just to name drop two of hundreds. No, I think we should just stick with reform. The MPAA shouldn’t be able to do what they do.
