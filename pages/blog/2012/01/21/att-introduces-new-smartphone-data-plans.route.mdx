> AT&T today announced new smartphone data plans with larger data allocations, the first update to AT&T’s plans since June of 2010. The plans kick in this Sunday, January 22.

Please, let it be a dream…

> -  AT&T DataPlus 300MB: $20 for 300MB, additional 300MB for $20.
> -  AT&T DataPro 3GB: $30 for 3GB, additional 1GB for $10/each
> -  AT&T DataPro 5GB: $50 for 5GB, with mobile hotspot/tethering, additional 1GB for $10/each

I don’t think it’s a dream. And what this means in practical terms is that everything has gone up $5.00. And the split between the low end plan and the mid range plan is still laughable.
