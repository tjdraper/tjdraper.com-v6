> Federal prosecutors in Virginia have shut down notorious file-sharing site Megaupload.com and charged the service’s founders with violating piracy laws. The Associated Press broke the story on Thursday, reporting that the indictment accuses Megaupload.com’s owner with costing copyright holders including record labels and movie studios more than $500 million in lost revenue.

Remind me why we need to pass SOPA/PIPA? Looks like they are already doing what they say they need the anti-constitutional legislation to do.
