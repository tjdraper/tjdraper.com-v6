> In the two minutes it took Deverett to buy a drink, thieves smashed a hole in the rear window of his car and made off with his Apple purchases. Deverett didn’t notice until he got back in the car and began backing up – he turned around just in time to see what was left of his rear window collapsing into pieces.

Let me get this straight, the guy left his brand new expensive computer in his car, which was broken into, and he blames Apple? Can you say entitlement?

Wow, what is this world coming to.

Bonus: Further on in the article, a woman who had her iPhone stolen is featured.

> She filled out a police report. She suspended her service with Fido and called Apple to report the theft. Although staff at both companies seemed to her to be practiced at offering condolences: “We’re very sorry your phone was stolen,” she was told more than once, they didn’t offer anything else.

In the end, she paid more than $600 for another iPhone.

Of course they “didn’t offer anything else”, it was her phone, and it was stolen. What’s Apple supposed to do? Replace every stole iPhone out there?
