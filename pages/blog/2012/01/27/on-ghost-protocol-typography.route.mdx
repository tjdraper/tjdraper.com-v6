> But as a type designer — meaning, someone who designs fonts — one quibble. A number of scenes had subtitles or captions. All of these were set in the font Verdana. There are two problems with Verdana.
> 
> First, it’s not functionally suitable. Verdana is a Microsoft font, designed in 1996 to optimize the legibility of small-size text on low-resolution movie screens.
> 
> Second, it’s not stylistically suitable. Verdana is a built-in font on nearly every Windows and Mac computer. It’s used on zillions of web pages. It’s ubiquitous. Therefore, the person who uses Verdna suggests to readers, “I couldn’t be bothered to pick anything better.” It’s also well-known as the corporate font of IKEA — probably not the association you’re going for.

And you may have thought I was a “font nerd”. See, there’s “font nerds”, and then there’s “**font nerds**”. I watched _Ghost Protocol_ without noticing this faux pas.
