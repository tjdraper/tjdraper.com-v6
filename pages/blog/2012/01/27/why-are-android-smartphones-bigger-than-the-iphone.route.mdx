> A different theory occurred to me over the weekend. To wit: that Android smartphones have grown enormously in order to accommodate LTE. Currently-available LTE chipsets are physically bigger ([AnandTech made the case](http://www.anandtech.com/show/4925/why-no-lte-iphone-5-blame-28nm-maturity) months ago that none of them would fit in the iPhone 4/4S case design), and because they’re so power-hungry, they require bigger batteries. Thicker phones aren’t going to fly. Thus: wider and taller phones with displays expanding to fill the surface.

There is a reason why Apple is not yet using LTE. The tradeoffs are simply too great at this time. And I simply would not buy a smartphone bigger than the iPhone. The iPhone is pretty much the perfect size as far as I’m concerned. And I don’t just say that because I’m an Apple fanboy™. Larger phones simply are not appealing to me. Big clunky, bulky things that don’t fit well in your pocket… no thanks.
