I have only recently discovered 5by5, but I definitely listen to podcasts a lot more now. Dan Benjamin has done something magical with 5by5 and I believe this is the future of broadcasting. I can listen to any show I want when I have time to do so.

I have a daily commute of 45 minutes each way and several of these wonderfully geeky podcasts help pass the drive much more quickly. In fact I was just commenting to my wife about how I wish I didn’t subscribe to quite so many 5by5 podcasts because now it’s hard to listen to audio books when I’d rather listen to the latest show.

The 5by5 model is interesting. You will often find that many sites and/or individual bloggers will have a podcast, but I have not seen a network of great podcasts under one roof until now. In fact, 5by5 may have made me a bit lazy because seldom do I try to find other podcasts now. But it’s not like I was really into many podcasts before. I tried a few times to find some podcasts I liked but never really got anywhere. Now, there’s 5by5.

If you are a geek, interested in geeks, web design, Apple, or anything along those lines I suggest you check out 5by5.

My favorite podcasts are:

-   [The Talk Show](http://5by5.tv/talkshow)
-   [Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical)
-   [Build and Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze)
-   [The Ihnatko Almanac](http://5by5.tv/ia)
-   [Geek Friday](http://5by5.tv/geekfriday)
-   [The Incomparable](http://5by5.tv/incomparable)
