> 1. Call a meeting of all top executives.
> 2. Pull my iPhone 4S out and rest it gently on the table in front of me.
> 3. Wait for dramatic effect.
> 4. Fire anyone not patient enough to wait for me to speak first.
> 5. Tell everyone left in the room that they have 3 months to bring me a working prototype that makes me want to use it over my iPhone. (While gesturing towards my iPhone already placed on the table.)
> 6. Fire anyone that asks “How?”
> 7. With everyone gone, hire a new executive team.

Right on.
