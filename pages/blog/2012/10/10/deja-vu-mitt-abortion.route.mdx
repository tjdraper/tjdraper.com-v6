It's too bad we didn't [**know about this**](/blog/2012/09/04/mitt-wont-touch-abortion).

> Mitt Romney said Tuesday he has no plans to push for legislation limiting abortion, a softer stance from a candidate who has said he would "get rid of" funding for Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
>
> “There’s no legislation with regards to abortion that I’m familiar with that would become part of my agenda,” the Republican presidential nominee [told The Des Moines Register](http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda/article) in an interview.

I sure wish we all could have somehow known that Romney is a flip-flopper and has historically either been very soft on the murder of unborn babies, or outright supported it...
