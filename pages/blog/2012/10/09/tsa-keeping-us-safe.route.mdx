> A dying woman says a a security pat-down at Sea-Tac Airport left her embarrassed in front of crowds of people.
>
> Michelle Dunaj says screeners checked under bandages from recent surgeries and refused to give her a private search when she requested one.
>
> Dunaj, who is dying of leukemia, carried a large amount of prescription drugs through Sea-Tac to head to Hawaii for what would be one of the last trips of her life.
>
> She called Alaska Airlines ahead of time to request a wheelchair and to ask how her medicines should be separated for the security line.
>
> "I did everything they asked me to do, so I didn't think it would be an issue," she said.
>
> But Dunaj says nothing went right at the security checkpoint.
>
> A machine couldn't get a reading on her saline bags, so a TSA agent forced one open, contaminating the fluid she needs to survive.
