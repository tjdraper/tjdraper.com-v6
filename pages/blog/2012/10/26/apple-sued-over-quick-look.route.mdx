> Non-practicing entity WhitServe on Friday filed a complaint against Apple, claiming that the Quick Look function found in a number of OS X iterations infringes on its file viewing patent from 2011.
>
> In its claim, filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, WhitServe alleges that Quick Look violates the company's U.S. Patent [No. 7,921,139](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=5&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=20110405.PD.&s2=%28CT.ASST.%29&OS=ISD/04/05/2011+AND+AS/CT&RS=ISD/04/05/2011+AND+AS/CT) for a "System for sequentially opening and displaying files in a directory," which was applied for in 2006 and granted in April of 2011./p>

This is why we can't have nice things. This is in a nutshell everything that is wrong with our patent and copyright system.
