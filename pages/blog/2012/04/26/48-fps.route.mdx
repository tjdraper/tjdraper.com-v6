Precisely! As a filmmaker, I will fight this to the last. I will shoot a film at 48 FPS only at gunpoint. There is a reason 24 FPS became the industry standard. It’s not just about how much more information you can capture at higher frame rates. That’s not at all what makes a movie. It’s about the look and feel, the aesthetic. 24 FPS has a certain quality to it that’s hard to define. But when you watch video that has been shot at 30 FPS, you can definitely feel the difference.

And I do have to debunk one thing this guy said at the beginning of the linked article.

> The low frame rate results in a strobing effect when there is moderate camera movement.

Rather the opposite is actually true. Higher frame rates result in a strobing effect. Many things come into play, such as shutter speed, lighting etc. But for the most part the problem with higher shutter speeds, or higher frame rates is that motion blurring is reduced, everything is hard, crisp and clean from frame to frame (think ESPN sports). But that is not at all pleasing to the eye. Motion blurring is a good thing. One of the first things I learned when creating graphics in After Effects is to turn on Motion Blurring to make it look more smooth and real. Increasing the frame rate does not eliminate strobing, it actually creates it.

As much as I love(d) The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, I don’t think I’ll be seeing The Hobbit because I think Peter Jackson is skipping the fundamentals of film making and equating it all to technology.
