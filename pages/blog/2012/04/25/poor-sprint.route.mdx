> Sprint’s unlimited data plans don’t seem to be as big a draw as it had hoped when it comes to selling the iPhone. Sprint sold 1.5 million iPhone 4 and 4S handsets in the first quarter, compared to the 3.2 million Verizon and 4.3 million AT&T activated in the same period.

The problem could be that unlimited data does no good when you can’t use it. I’m not in the middle of nowhere, but if I were with Sprint I would be roaming on Verizon 1X here at my house. AT&T may still be 2G in my area, but at least they have a cell site here.

As far as I can tell, coverage with Sprint is far worse than AT&T. So no thank you!
