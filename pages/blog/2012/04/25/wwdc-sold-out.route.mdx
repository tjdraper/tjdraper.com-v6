Sorry kids:

> If you’re an Apple developer and you haven’t already snagged a ticket for this year’s WWDC, better luck next year: Apple has updated its [WWDC Web site](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) with an indication that tickets for this year’s event are no longer available – they’re sold out.

Pretty crazy. Glad I’m not a developer trying to go.
