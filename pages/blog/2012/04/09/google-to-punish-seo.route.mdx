> Matt Cutts, Google head of search spam, recently said that the company will soon roll out an algorithm that looks to credit companies that focus on quality content. While most of Google’s adjustments have been aimed at bringing relevant content to users, a number of sites have found some backdoors to a strong search ranking that Cutts and Google hope to close.
> 
> Search Engine Roundtable reported that Google hopes to “level the playing field” with the latest update by reducing the rankings of sites that are “overly SEO‘ed” suggesting it will give more attention to sites with less technically savvy SEO elements but strong content. As the web has evolved, GoogleBot, the series of algorithms used to rank websites after search queries, has similarly become more sophisticated.

This seems like a good thing to me. I hate SEO and am (mostly) determined to ignore it.
