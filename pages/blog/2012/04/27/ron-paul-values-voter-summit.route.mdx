Remind me why some theonomists have a problem with Ron Paul? This is most excellent, and certainly very Christian in perspective. Dr. Paul doesn’t hold back.

And sure, it must be said I didn’t agree with every single little nuance, but any quibbles I had were small and not worth mentioning. I’m sure the anti-Paul crowd will pull those little things out and trumpet them, but frankly I can find quibbles of the same size with my own Pastor, whom I love and respect a lot and would vote him in to any political office in a heartbeat.
