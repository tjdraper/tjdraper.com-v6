They were working on a new, more Google-like interface a while back but they have seemingly abandoned it what with the Beta for this interface being gone. It’s too bad that Google has seemingly lost interest in Feedburner, because it’s an awesome service for RSS feed analytics.

Perhaps someone can educate me, why would I want to use Feedburner? All the popular CMSes and blogging tools serve feeds just fine on their own, straight from the horses mouth as it were. I’m using an ExpressionEngine RSS template for the feed here on Apple User Pro. Why would I possibly want to use Feedburner. I don’t get it. If I’m completely missing some information or something, [send in a comment to me](mailto:feedback@appleuserpro.com) and let me know but I don’t understand what incentive I could possibly have to run my RSS through Feedburner.
