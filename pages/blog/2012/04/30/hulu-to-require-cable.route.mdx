> If you love watching TV shows on Hulu but don’t have a cable subscription, things could get a bit more complicated in the near future. According to the New York Post, Hulu could soon start requiring its users to prove that they also have a cable or satellite subscription.

It’s as if they want us to pirate content. I suspect that the large contingent of folks using Hulu who don’t have a cable subscription (like myself) are cord cutters. This entire concept just completely blows my mind. I pay Hulu a subscription fee plus I watch 3 commercials every, what is it 15 minutes or less? while I’m watching a show on Hulu. But they also want me to have a cable subscription? This isn’t just double dipping, this is triple dipping. It’s treating your customers like garbage, and sooner or later this is going to come back to bite them.

Oh, if they do require proof of cable subscription, I will instantly cancel my Hulu Plus subscription.
