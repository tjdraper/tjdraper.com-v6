He goes on to say how he is not upset or unhappy with the Mac App Store.

Well I am. I am both deeply concerned, and very upset with what Apple is doing. Apple’s approach was already restrictive when they first opened the Mac App Store. But now they are turning the screws even tighter.

Consider the disparity between versions of Coda 2. Now, Coda 2 is absolutely a power user’s tool, you use it to write code, connect to FTP servers, and SSH for crying out loud. But there are certain advantages to being in the Mac App Store, namely iCloud syncing of saved sites. I had a really hard time making up my mind about whether I wanted Mac App Store Coda 2, or Direct Download Coda 2. At any time, Apple could tighten down the screws of the App Store even tighter and kill real functionality that I use all the time in Coda. Coda 2 slid in before the Sandboxing deadline, and there is no way Coda would be nearly as good or useful if it adhered to Apple’s Sandboxing. But certain features are not available to the non App Store version of Coda 2.

The problem is that Apple is starting to fence off parts of the operating system for Mac App Store apps only. Clearly Apple believes if you want to develop a good Application, then you should be distributing it through the Mac App Store where the best APIs and services are available to you. And make no mistake, I believe the only reason the Mac is open to software outside of the Mac App Store is because pandora’s box was opened almost 30 years ago. If you want proof, look at iOS. If Apple created the Mac today… well, news flash, they did create the equivalent of the Mac today, it’s the iPhone and iPad.

And, I’m not even saying that it’s not the right model. I’m saying that Apple’s approach to it is starting to become a little too tight fisted. Here’s a question, how many of Apple’s own apps in the Mac App Store adhere to sandboxing policy? Do you really think Final Cut Pro X adhere’s to sandboxing policy?

Consider iBooks on iOS. iBooks is allowed to adjust system brightness. No other app is allowed access to that API and would be rejected from the app store if they tried (we know because some apps have tried that). But Apple’s iBooks available freely in the App Store does just that.

Look, Apple can do what it wants to do, I’m not arguing that it’s technically wrong. I am arguing that they need to step back and take a good, long, hard look at the issues here. I don’t personally use 1Password, but it’s a great app, and it’s not like it’s some system level utility or anything. If it can’t be in the app store, there are some deep issues here.
