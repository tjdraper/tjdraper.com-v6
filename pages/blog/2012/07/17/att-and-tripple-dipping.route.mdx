> Like it does with the iOS Personal Hotspot feature, U.S. carrier AT&T appears set to control and charge for the iOS 6 FaceTime over Cellular feature.

Because capping your data, charging for overages, and having a separate, higher rate plan for tethering are all not enough. AT&T needs to also charge you another fee for accessing your limited data.

This is getting ridiculous.
