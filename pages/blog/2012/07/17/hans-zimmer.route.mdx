> I’ve been a Zimmer fan boy for years now, and if you ask me why, I might just punch you in the face; because contrary to popular opinion, there is such a thing as a stupid question, and that is one. Now, moving on… To say that I eagerly awaited the release of this score would be an understatement of staggering proportions. I was counting down the weeks, the days, the hours and the minutes. Well, the waiting is over now. It’s finally here. Finally. No more waiting. The score for The Dark Knight Rises has been unleashed on the world – and it’s bigger, bolder, and better than I could ever have imagined.

Hans Zimmer is, hands down, one of the best film composers I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Let’s review some of the great stuff he’s done:

_My **favorite** favorites in bold._

-   The Lion King
-   The Rock
-   The Prince of Egypt
-   **Gladiator**
-   Mission: Impossible II
-   **Batman Begins**
-   **Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest**
-   Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End
-   **Batman: The Dark Knight**
-   **Sherlock Holmes**
-   Inception
-   Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
-   Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
-   **The Dark Knight Rises**

And he just keeps on going. And of course there’s many more than this. These are just the ones I really like. I can’t imagine a world where Hans Zimmer did not compose the score for the new Batman movies. I would not want to live in such a place.
