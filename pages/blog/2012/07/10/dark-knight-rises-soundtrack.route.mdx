> As part of our countdown to the release of The Dark Knight Rises, we have a very special treat for you today. Below you can listen to the film’s Hans Zimmer soundtrack in its entirety, giving you a taste of the atmosphere and action you’re in for come July 20. And before you ask, we’ve closely parsed the track titles and none of them reads “Death Of Qui-Gon” so we’re pretty sure that this is free of overt spoilers.

You may now go listen. GO!
