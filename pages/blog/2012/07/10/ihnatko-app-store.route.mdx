> That’s what many Mac developers are dealing with right now. An app does syncing through MobileMe. Now, it needs to do it through iCloud. Fine. But Apple won’t let an app use iCloud unless it’s sold in the App Store. Fine. But Apple won’t approve an app for the App Store unless it’s sandboxed. And for many developers, sandboxing means that half of their app’s features will either no longer work at all, or will need to be dumbed way, way down. Selling your app there also means being cut off from any kind of simple and direct line of communication with your users.

I rarely agree completely with Andy Ihnatko. I often find him to be too cynical, un-understanding of what Apple is trying to do, and over-bearing. However I, like him, am just a little worried about where Apple is going and how far they are pushing it with iCloud, Sandboxing, and the Mac App Store in general.

I know I [wrote in my Gatekeeper article](http://mac.appstorm.net/general/opinion/gatekeeper-better-security-or-big-brother/) at the Mac Appstorm that I was okay with Apple’s approach thus far, and I mostly am. But I am concerned with how Apple is forcing developers into a box with the App Store, Sandboxing, and iCloud.
