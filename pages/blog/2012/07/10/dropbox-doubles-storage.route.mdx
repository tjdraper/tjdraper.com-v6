> Today we’re happy to announce that our upgrades are getting a huge upgrade! Dropbox Pro now comes in flavors of 100 and 200 GB, but at the price of the original 50 and 100 GB plans. For those of you who need even more space, a brand new 500 GB plan is also joining the posse! If you’re already a Dropbox Pro subscriber, just take a seat and enjoy the fireworks — your Dropbox will supersize itself automatically tonight.

I didn’t think I could love Dropbox anymore, and then they get all crazy like this. Dropbox is cloud storage and sync done right. I never, ever pay any attention to drop box, I just put stuff in my Dropbox folder, or a Dropbox shared folder with someone I’m collaborating on a project with, and it just works. It’s too bad Apple can’t take some cues from a great service for iCloud.
