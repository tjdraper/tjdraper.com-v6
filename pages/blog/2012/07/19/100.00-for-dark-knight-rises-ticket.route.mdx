> “Scalpers reportedly are re-selling The Dark Knight Rises’ midnight IMAX tickets for $65-$100 apiece on both Craigslist and StubHub for NYC’s AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13 — higher even than for Avengers.

Crazy. I want to see this movie quite a lot, but not that much (besides which I already have my tickets for Saturday).
