> iCloud’s promise is a dream: your contacts, calendar, backups, songs, documents and application data are on all of your devices, whenever and wherever you need them. No need to worry about moving files from device to device on a flash drive or emailing them or any of the other crazy stuff we used to do. All of your stuff, always there when you need it. If that were completely the case, it would be a no-brainer for me. I’d implement iCloud syncing immediately, because that idea—never having to worry about where my stuff is again—is one of those ideas that makes my heart flutter with excitement.

A thoughtful take on the state of iCloud and data syncing.
