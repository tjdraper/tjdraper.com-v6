> CUPERTINO, California—July 30, 2012—Apple® today announced that downloads of OS X® Mountain Lion have exceeded three million in four days, making it the most successful OS X release in Apple’s history.

A smashing success, no doubt spurred on by the almost unbelievable price. Whoever heard of buying a desktop OS for $19.99?

Additionally, I have to say that this release is, so far as I can tell at this point, the most stable initial release of OS X. Period. When I really started getting into Macintosh and first bought my own, the current release of OS X was 10.3.4 Panther. Panther was always rock solid for me.

After that, it seemed to me that general system stability only declined with each release, especially initially. With of course the normal ups and downs. Lion was a particularly buggy, messy, unfit and un-Apple like release. It is _really_ good to see how stable Mountain Lion is. It really is the first time I have upgraded to a new version of OS X and really felt that my system was as stable as previously.
