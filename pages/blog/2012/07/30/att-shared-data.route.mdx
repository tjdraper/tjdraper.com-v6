I’ve been meaning to get to this for a while.

Count me in the category where I would have to spend significantly more money, but in my case that would be for half the data that I currently have for my one phone, but to share between us. Here’s the math.

1 GB of data (not enough) = $40.00

2 Smartphones = $90.00.

90 + 40 = $130.00.

And that’s for less data. An additional GB would be another $15.00 and I could see jumping into that at least half of the months in a year. Still cheaper than the next tier up of 4 GB. But the months we dip into that next GB, the amount of our bill jumps up to $145.00. All figures are significantly higher than our current plan and features which cost $100.00 per month. We have 550 minutes which we never use, an additional line to the primary line for $9.99, my 2 GB data plan for $25.00, my Wife’s 200 MB data plan for $15.00.

Granted with the new family share plans we would now have unlimited text and talk… two things which I care absolutely nothing about. My wife and I have so many roll over minutes it’s not funny, because we _never_ use our monthly allotment of minutes (550). We have pay as you go texting because iMessage has made our actual carrier SMS use almost nil. We use maybe 4 actual SMSes per month between us. At 25¢ each, it’s not hard to swallow.

I don’t know how typical this is, but from my perspective it feels like the carriers are really out of touch with the needs of the common folk. My use case doesn’t seem that out of the ordinary.
