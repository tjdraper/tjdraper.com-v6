> Blockbuster superhero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man is to be the first of a trilogy after Marc Webb’s film broke box-office records in the US when it opened earlier this week.

I have not seen it yet on principle. I loved Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy and this entire concept of a complete reboot seemed too soon and disrespectful. But… I have heard from several friends and other people I like and/or trust that it is a good film and that I should see it. I probably will, but I don’t know if I’ll make it to the theatre to do so. I might wait for the DVD (Blu-ray, whatever).
