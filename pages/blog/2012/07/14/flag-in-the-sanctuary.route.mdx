> A Christian church has absolutely no business displaying a national flag in the sanctuary, at least not as it is commonly done. The church born at Pentecost was a reversal of Babel, not a doubling down on the fragmentation of Babel.

Doug Wilson (and apparently two others, but I don’t know who they are). Wilson is right on with his entire take. The other two, not so much, but Wilson’s entire thing is worth a read. I completely agree.
