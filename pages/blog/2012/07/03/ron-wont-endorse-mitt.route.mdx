> In the wake of his son’s endorsement of the presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, many have wondered whether or not the elder Paul will fall in line and compromise his principles to back Romney. Well Ron Paul has put those concerns to rest. On CNN’s Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer Paul stated that despite Rand Paul’s endorsement of Romney, he would not be following suit for the former governor of Massachusetts.

I’m glad someone in the Paul family is willing to stand on their principles.
