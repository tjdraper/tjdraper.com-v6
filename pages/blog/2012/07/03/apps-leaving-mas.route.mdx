This is getting to be a problem. Developers are a little frustrated with the App Store rules for Mac. The thing is I don’t completely disagree with them. I agree in principle with sandboxing and app review but I think Apple is really screwing it up. They need to do something about it. And when I say need, don’t misunderstand me. Apple is doing well, making a killing and all that. But if they aren’t careful, they are going to drive the good developers out of the app store(s). Then you just have a bunch of junk. In my opinion, Apple should tread lightly here and fix the issues.
