> There is no single issue of greater concern to conservatives and Christians as the issue of life. Without it, there are no other rights, and all other political debate becomes moot. So, you would assume there would be a distinct difference in the two candidates on this issue.
>
> If you were to make that judgment solely on the basis of the candidates’ rhetoric, you would be right. However, I can tell people I look like Mr. Universe until I’m bluer in the face than Papa Smurf, but that doesn’t necessarily make it true.

…

> So, where does Romney stand? Just a tad to the left, believe it or not.
>
> His “ObamaCare only better,” Commonwealth Care, provides for taxpayer subsidized abortion, even in elective cases; copays are only $50. He placed members of the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors on the board the oversees the healthcare program, thereby guaranteeing it would remain a taxpayer subsidized “right.”
>
> Commonwealth Care was instituted in 2006, roughly two years AFTER is supposed “pro-life conversion.” He praised the legislation, and went on to appoint the Planned Parenthood board members to the oversight committee, until it was politically expedient to deny he had anything to do with it.

> OK, so that was more than six years ago, right? Ancient history in the world of politics, right?

> So, let’s look at what he’s done for us lately, shall we? How about the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser held for his benefit in May at the Florida home of Phil Frost? For those of you who don’t know, that’s the CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals, which happens to be the maker of the Plan-B “morning after pill.”

…

> So, Romney took it upon himself to: 1) violate the Constitution of Massachusetts, thereby violating his Oath of Office, and 2) usher in a new “civil rights movement” by ordering gay marriage into effect. He directed new marriage licenses be created to eliminate words like “husband” and “wife,” replacing them with “Party A” and “Party B.” Then he abused his power as the state’s chief magistrate to coerce officials who didn’t comply with the “new law” he created.

I can’t and shouldn’t copy and paste everything from this article. [Just go read it](http://stevedeace.com/news/national-politics/common-sense-voting-lesser-of-two-evils-obama-appreciates-your-support/)! And if you are planning on voting for Romney because he’s “better” than Obama, I pray this article will open your eyes. I have never been a huge proponent of the idea that we can’t vote for someone that is the lesser of two evils, but in the case of Romney, there is no lesser about it. Romney is at lest as bad as President Obama, and perhaps worse.
