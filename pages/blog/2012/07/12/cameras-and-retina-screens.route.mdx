> The Rebel photos look decent. The 5D Mark II photos look great. But photos from the iPhone 4, and even from the 4S, donâ€™t hold up. They look fine on a 3.5-inch screen, but they look terrible on my big desktop monitor and abysmal on the Retina MacBook Pro.

This is not good, not good at all. I almost never take photos with my SLR anymore either because my iPhone is always with me, and taking pictures with it is easier. But I have noticed the less usable nature of them. And now this.
