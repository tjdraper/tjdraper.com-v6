> The Acer Aspire S5 is actually thinner and lighter than a 13-inch MacBook Air, but has meager battery life and costs $200 more. That must be the Apple Tax at work, because all I’m ever told is I can buy better PCs for less than the cost of a comparable Mac.

I’ve noticed this trend for a while. Long before Macs gained their current popularity, a PC of similar specifications that wouldn’t fall apart after a few months was just as much money. This was in 2004 when I bought my first Mac. Now, Macs are actually less expensive comparatively.

What confuses people I think is that Apple does not compete on the really low end. If Apple cannot make the product of a decent quality, then they don’t make it.
