> For example, one of the actions you can make happen in Launch Center Pro is “Open Facebook and launch notifications.” This action takes you right to your notifications in Facebook. So here is the thing: to use this shortcut I have to press Launch Center on my Home Screen then press the action button that then takes me to Facebook’s app and opens my notifications. If you’re keeping count, that’s the same number of gestures/presses I already use without Launch Center to get to my Facebook notifications the traditional way: I tap the Facebook app on my Home Screen then tap the notifications button, and I’m there.

Ditto. I don’t get it.
