> Now that Stargate is no longer on television and MGM (the studio that owns the rights to the franchise) is under new management — a management that so far has been focusing more on recovering the film side of the historic studio’s business — it seems like more than wishful thinking.

…

I love Stargate. Specifically, I love the Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis TV series. The original movie was mediocre to it’s very core and only worth watching to get the beginning of the story. The idea that Devlin and Emmerich want to ignore the TV work that followed up on the movie, and do a direct sequel to the Stargate Movie smacks of arrogance and pride, as well as spitting in the fans’ faces.

What we want (I think I speak for most Stargate fans), is more Stargate that follows the story and chronology of _all_ Stargate. Not a writer and a director with something to prove, pride to maintain, and grapes to sour.
