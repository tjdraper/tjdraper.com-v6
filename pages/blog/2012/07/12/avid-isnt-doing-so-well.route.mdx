> Avid have been in poor financial health for a while, the company has been shedding jobs on a regular basis to try and keep costs down. In October 2011 Avid laid off 10% of their workforce and today Avid announced that they intend to reduce the headcount further by another 20%.

In trying to broaden my base and knowledge of NLEs, I tried using Avid a little bit. As much as I complained about how dated Final Cut 7 looked and felt at times, Avid is in _far_ worse shape. It’s mired in old paradigms that don’t work in the digital age, a steep learning curve, senseless and cluttered UI, and a host of other problems I’m not going to take the time to get into right now. Suffice it to say I do not wonder why they are not doing well.
