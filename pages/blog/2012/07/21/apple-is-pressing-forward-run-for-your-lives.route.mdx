> The simple solution (which I’m using now) is an external display – but it won’t be long before Retina Cinema Displays replace their outdated siblings. Apple has made it clear that “Pro” users aren’t their bread and butter anymore so, as they push Retina technology forward, 1x will be forcibly left behind.

Oh. My. Word. I don’t even know where to start. Apple double the resolution of their monitor is an “anti-pro” feature? Man we’re really reaching now to keep this stupidness alive. Also, [as Marco points out](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/17/the-retina-war-is-upon-us), you can still get old CRT monitors and plug them into your Mac. _Still_. Why exactly is this going to somehow be different with LCDs?

Idiots all.
