> Warm up your broadband connections, because Mountain Lion is now available for public consumption. Apple released OS X 10.8 to the Mac App Store on Wednesday morning, less than a day after announcing its third-quarter earningsâ€”just as we originally predicted. The release weighs in at 4.05GB and costs a flat $19.99 for the upgrade, so long as your Mac is supported.

Now waiting to see what reports come in of bugs and stuff.
