Most of us who use and enjoy Apple products do so for one basic reason. Don’t get me wrong there are many reasons, but I think one of the biggest reasons can be summed up thusly. Apple product users like nice things. That’s it. That’s the major reason I use Apple’s products. I don’t want an eight pound piece of garbage Dell laptop sitting on my desk or weighing down my lap. I don’t want a non-symmetrical piece of junk Droid vibrating off my desk because there’s no good way to lay it. I don’t want my devices cluttered with buttons or useless ports.

This penchant for nice things does not stop with hardware. We like nice software, perhaps even more than we like nice hardware. If I was ever forced to choose between a Mac running Windows, or a PC running OS X, which would I choose? And I’m not saying this is logical or could ever happen, but just as a thought exercise, which would I choose? Hands down and without question or hesitation I would choose the PC running OS X because I like nice software, and that obviously means it ranks more importantly to me than nice hardware (though to be sure I want nice hardware).

Once Upon a Time…
-----------------

…There was Tweetie for Mac and iPhone. Tweetie was good software. But one day (as Tweetie was walking along all by itself on a lonesome path no doubt, to continue the “once upon a time” theme) Twitter came by and ate Tweetie. Tweetie was re-released for free and subsequently died a slow and painful, horrible death. Features were removed or changed in a way that users hated. The life was smothered out of this once beautiful application. Many of us began looking for alternatives and finally, _finally_ Tweetbot came along.

But for a long time, there has not been a good Mac Twitter client. I used Twitterific for a while, and then more recently, Osfoora. But it’s never really filled the whole in my heart that the death of Tweetie left.

Meanwhile
---------

Tweetbot displaced Tweetie as _the best_ Twitter client. Not just the best Twitter client on iOS, but the best Twitter client. Period. There are only a handful of what I would consider top notch applications I have and use everyday on my iPhone. Tweetbot is one of them. Whether you use Twitter or not, you should get it just because it’s such a beautiful and well executed app (I jest, but only kind of).

Then a few weeks ago Tweetbot for Mac was teased. A screenshot made it’s way out of Tapbots HQ. And the cry for a Mac version of Tweetbot reached an all-time high. I have been known to tweet at the Tapbots Twitter account from time to time my desire for a Mac version.

It has transparency (wait, isn’t that what Alpha means?)
--------------------------------------------------------

Today, Tweetbot for Mac was released in Alpha to the public. This is a first for Tapbots, but probably because that’s just not possible to do on iOS.

And let me tell you, even though this is an alpha release, it has already won my heart. Yes there’s a few little glitches and bugs — it is an Alpha after all, but it is definitely already quality software. I look forward to seeing how the company refines Tweetbot for Mac.
