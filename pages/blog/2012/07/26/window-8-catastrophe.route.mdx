> Valve head—and one-time Microsoft employee—Gabe Newell has branded Windows 8 “a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space” at videogame conference Casual Connect in Seattle.

Well, everyone except for Apple (taking the term PC to mean personal computer, and not _Windows_ computer).

> He argued that one of the last remaining things keeping people away from Linux was the lack of games.

Well, that, and the fact that Windows is the most backwards, _not_ user-friendly, and hard to use Operating System in existence.
