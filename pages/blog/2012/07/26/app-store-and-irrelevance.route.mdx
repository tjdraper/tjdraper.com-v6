Marco has a few thoughts, and harsh words:

> The problem with sandboxing isn’t that any particular app is incompatible with the current entitlements. It’s a deeper problem than that: Apple is significantly reducing the number of apps that can be sold in the Store after people have already bought them.
>
> Apple’s stance seems to be pretty typical of them: comply with the new rules or leave. This usually works for them, but this time, they’ve made a critical strategic error: leaving is often a better option, or the only option, for the affected developers. Many of them have already left, and many more will.

It’s a tad early to call it a mass exodus, but this is becoming a common refrain among the apps I use all the time. And it’s not like I’m using weird apps or anything like that. And I can tell you this, I am seriously considering buying my apps outside the App Store when that opportunity is available for the apps I want to buy. I have simply lost confidence in the App Store. I think Apple is seriously jeopardizing it’s third party developer ecosystem. It seems like a really strange thing for Apple to run all the fish out of it’s pond, when the fish in the pond are a major part of the attraction to the pond.

Go read Marco’s whole article, but I must quote his last paragraph here:

> The Mac App Store is in significant danger of becoming an irrelevant, low-traffic flea market where buyers rarely venture for serious purchases. And I bet that’s not what Apple had in mind at all.

Hey Apple, hint: **you’re doing it wrong!**
