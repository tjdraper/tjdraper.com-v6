> Apple is either actively considering purchasing a major stake in Twitter or discussed making an investment with the social company more than a year ago and the talks have since ceased, depending on which newspaper one wishes to believe.

I hope itâ€™s the first one. I would like to see Apple get a stake in Twitter and I hope that it would push the Twitter ecosystem to stay as it is.
