> At first glance, Contacts (the application formerly known as Address Book) does not appear to have strayed much from its boldly skeuomorphic incarnation in Lion. But there are some important differences.

> First, the much-bemoaned loss of the three-pane view that shows groups, the contact list, and the details of a single contact has been reversed. The new incarnation of this view feels a bit like it’s been shoehorned into the book design, which dictates that the left and right “pages” be the same width. Still, it’s a lot better than being limited to two views of your contact information.

This is one of two changes that I am so glad happened. The address book was almost unusable to me in Lion. Though I’m still irritated that it’s limited in size, and you can’t change the size of the two main panels, having the three panel view available again is such a step back up to where we were. It’s at least usable again.
