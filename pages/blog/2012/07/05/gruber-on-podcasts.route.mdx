> Where I think Podcasts falls short (and Knight touches on this as well) is in providing for a single iCloud-backed set of podcast subscriptions. If I subscribe to a podcast in iTunes on my Mac, it should show up as a subscription on Podcasts on my iPhone.

Yes. A thousand times yes. This was my biggest disappointment with the app. iCloud backed subscriptions is what I thought I was getting with “Podcasts” and I couldn’t have been more wrong. I could put up with a lot of annoyances if iCloud backed subscriptions and playback position syncing were properly integrated.
