> But after hearing [Jim and Dan talk about links](http://5by5.tv/amplified/12), I started getting nervous about if my previous method was the right one. After a nice chat on the phone, Jim encouraged me in how I was linking at the top of my posts, saying the mechanics didn’t really matter as much as intention and practice.

I’m happy to see another DaringFireball style linked list. I think that is absolutely the way to link. This also seemed like a good time for me to talk about my linking practice on BuzzingPixel. Original articles that I write here will have a bit larger headline which will not be underlined, will not have a double arrow at the end, and will permalink to the article here on the site. Linked List post headlines instead take you to the site I’m linking to and quoting, and are indicated but the underline and the double arrow at the end of the title, as well as a permalink glyph (infinity symbol) to the right of the headline.

I also loved what [Marco had to say about linking practice](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/03/stop-not-linking).
