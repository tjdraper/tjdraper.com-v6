This is where I really get annoyed with Apple not communicating. Marco has a great list in his post of the apps that are affected. This is obviously an Apple problem at this point. As far as I can tell it’s fixed now [1](#fn:updatedinstapaper) , but even so Apple should have said something about this by now. This was obviously a widespread problem.

I love Apple but sometimes they make themselves a pain in our collective hind quarters. They should be communicating about this. An apology for the problem wouldn’t be such a bad thing either. We all understand technology has issues sometimes, so quit being stupid about it.
