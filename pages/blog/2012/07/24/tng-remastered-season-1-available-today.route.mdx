> The first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is finally here in HD. Just in time for the 25th anniversary, the series makes its debut on Blu-ray on Tuesday. TrekMovie has had some time to check out the new set and it is impressive. More details and photos in our review.

Be sure to go check out the screen shots. Like any good geek, I opened the comparison shots in tabs and switched back and forth between them to compare. I really love what they are doing with the remaster!
