> According to reports, James Holmes, 24, threw tear gas into a theater full of patrons watching “The Dark Knight Rises” before he began shooting, leaving 12 dead and 38 wounded. The police have him in custody. Holmes’ apartment building was evacuated, and the ATF is searching his home for possible explosives.

Wow. This is so tragic. I don’t think anyone goes to the theatre thinking really thinking, I wonder if something bad will happen in the theatre that will cause my death.
