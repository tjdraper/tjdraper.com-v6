> There’s room for one or two niche clients such as Sparrow, but only if they’re radically different from the system clients. Thunderbird isn’t. (And I can’t speak for its recent years, but for most of its history, it’s been good on Windows but buggy as \*\*\*\* on Macs.)

I can’t tell you how much I _don’t_ care that Thunderbird is end of life. It is in the top ten _most horrible_ email clients on the face of the earth. I would rather use Outlook (shudder). And Marco is absolutely right about it being worse on Mac.
