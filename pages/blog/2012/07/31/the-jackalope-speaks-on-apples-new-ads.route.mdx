> The portion of my post above is what Apple kool-aid at it’s best looks like. In truth, I think the ads stink. Most people like the idea of the Genius Bar. And those same people will shake their heads and ask themselves, “What was Apple thinking???”

Pretty funny. Until I got to this portion of Joseph’s post, I was ready to drive the five hours it takes me to get to his house and personally beat him black and blue. When I got to that though, I saw exactly what he was doing.

There is no excuse for Apple. And actually, this is worrying. This is the first sign I have seen that there may be a leadership problem at Apple. I think I have said, though I cannot find it, that if there is a leadership problem at Apple after the passing of Jobs, it will manifest itself very slowly at first. Apple is running on a lot of momentum. And if nothing else like this happens, we can just call it a mistake, or a bad judgement call. But it is just a bit worrying. These ads are tasteless, classless, and simply not very well thought out on any level. I wish Apple would pull them. This is the most embarrassed I have ever been to be an Apple guy.
