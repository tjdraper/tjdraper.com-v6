> Apple TV users began noticing the new “app” on their Apple TV interfaces on Tuesday morning, its presence later confirmed by Ars and the Hulu blog. A software update isn’t necessary in order to see the new option, but you do have to subscribe to Hulu Plus for $7.99 per month (with “limited” ads) in order to use it.

And now I _really_ want an Apple TV.
