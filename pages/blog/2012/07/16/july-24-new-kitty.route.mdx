> We’ve heard a few whispers (3 and counting) that Apple Stores both in the United States and overseas have planned overnights for Tuesday, July 24th. With OS X Mountain Lion launching “in July”, according to Apple, we believe that it is sensible to speculate that this overnight may point to a public launch the following day.

We shall see. I say this every year, but I’m just not sure how soon I’ll be upgrading this year. Wait and see what bugs crop up and all that.
