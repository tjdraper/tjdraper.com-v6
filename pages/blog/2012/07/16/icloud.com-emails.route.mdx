> Alongside the release of iOS 6 beta 3 with support for @icloud.com iCloud Mail domains, Apple has updated its iCloud.com beta website to support the new domain option.

Good… mostly. It’s irritating that Apple can’t make up it’s mind what domain it wants it’s users email addressees to be at, but I always, HATED @me.com. Stupidest branding ever, stupidest email address domain ever.
