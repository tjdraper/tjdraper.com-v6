Network shows are constrained by numerous regulations in order to qualify for network airing. Cable shows, especially those on premium channels such as HBO, have no such restrictions. By most criteria, the result has been that most of the best shows on television are on premium channels. Andy concludes: “Under the new rules, there’s the risk that Mac software might occasionally be as good as ‘The West Wing’ but it could never be as great as ‘Boardwalk Empire.’ \[For the time being\], there will be some very real limitations on how good a Mac app can be.”
