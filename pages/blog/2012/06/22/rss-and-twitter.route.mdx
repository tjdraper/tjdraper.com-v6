> Twitter is great. I funnel a lot of stuff from Twitter into Instapaper and Pinboard. But Twitter is a flowing river. I am not on Twitter all day so I miss the clever banter and people complaining about Twitter. RSS is time-shifted. RSS is targeted and bounded by my subscriptions. Clever hacks like IFTTT can make Twitter more like RSS but it’s a pale facsimile.

Exactly. I use Twitter to interact with people, and sure sometimes I get to articles from Twitter. But RSS is primarily what I use to keep up with stuff I care about. I don’t see that changing for a long time.
