> Apple has gone away from the all-in-one design to one that is almost identical of the Apple TV. By that I mean that it now requires a power cord. This may not seem like a big deal and maybe it isn’t (I’ll be on the road with it next week), but I certainly will miss just flipping out the prongs and plugging it in!

…

> I wished they had kept an all-in-one design as I don’t want to have to have one more cord to carry, but I’m sure I’ll be able to adjust. If you have a recent 802.11n model then there probably isn’t much of a reason to upgrade. However, if you’re on an older 802.11b/g model or you use one at home as your primary router, then you’ll want the new stuff in this one.

Interesting perspective on the update. I have an AirPort Express and have never cared for it too much so I thought the 2012 update looked like the exact update I would love were I in the market for an AirPort Express. But I see the point of changing it to need a cord being a negative, maybe not the smartest move by Apple.
