> For instance, there is only one Jony Ive. When he and his limited team of designers are working on a new—revolutionary—Macbook Pro with Retina Display that is as thin as a Macbook Air, they don’t have time to design an all-new Mac Pro in the same season. And while Apple’s programming engineers are feverishly trying to build a version of Final Cut Pro X that supports a Retina Display, they may not get to the other features you want in the pro-level video editor in time for WWDC.

While I mostly agree, I would also argue that the Mac Pro is more important to Apple than perhaps Apple even realizes. Consider: why does my entire imidiate family buy almost exclusively apple computers and other Apple electronics? Largely I think because I as a professional user of Apple products provide the family tech support and buying advice. If Apple does not supply my needs as a professional, I am liable to look somewhere else to have my professional needs met. I am not saying that I am considering jumping ship at this point, but professional Apple products are a staple for me. There is a need in my world for the Mac Pro. I often find myself working on a Mac Pro editing suite, and even the newest such machines are starting to feel pretty dated. My 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro now renders complex After Effects projects faster than the 8 core Xeon Mac Pro workstation I was using earlier today. This is not an acceptable situation when there are now far faster and more efficient desktop class processors available.

Consider App developers of both OS X and iOS. Sure they can and do develop on iMacs and MacBooks, but many of them prefer desktop class workhorses. [Such as Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2012/05/26/speculation-on-the-next-mac-pro).

If Apple wants to stay on top of the pile, I think they need to update their high end professional computer, and I think they need to do so sooner rather than later.
