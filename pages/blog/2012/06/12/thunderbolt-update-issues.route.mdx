> Some people are experiencing serious errors with Thunderbolt Software Update 1.2, released yesterday, according to reports. Affected users will see any number of issues when booting a Mac, ranging from “unexpected error” messages to kernel panics or becoming stuck at the gray boot screen.

As far as I can tell, this is limited to a handful of users (given that there’s not more outcry from the general population). All the same, it’s a bit concerning to me and I’m holding off on the update. I _almost_ did it last night and I forgot to hit the install button before I went to bed and never had time to do it before I started seeing the articles on this issue.

I am a bit concerned about Apple allowing out an update with even the remote possibility of this happening, but I’m willing to let it be the “occasional gaffe” that everyone is allowed to make once in a while if there are no other issues with updates for a while.
