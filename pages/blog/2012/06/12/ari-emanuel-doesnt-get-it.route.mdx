> As you can see in the video below, when the time came for the Q&A session with Ari, I got up and asked a question that he didn’t seem to like very much (my question starts at about 16:53, but you should watch the whole thing). The gist of my question was simple: does he think that in order to fight piracy, it’s AT&T, Verizon, and Google’s responsibility to create a roadblock to that content? Instead of answering or addressing the complication of the issue, he resorted to what amounts to an ad hominem attack.

I didn’t watch all the video, but I watched about 3 minutes of the beginning and then skipped to the part where Tolopsky asks his question. Emanuel is truly scary because he absolutely either does not understand, or is deliberately obfuscating the issue.

Topolsky’s article is well written and worth the read. I don’t really think I disagreed with anything he said.
