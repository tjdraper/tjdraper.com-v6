As usual, Apple has a parade of iOS devices that get left in the dust when iOS 6 comes out. And just as usual, older devices that don’t get completely left behind still don’t get all the new features. And as always, some of the things on the list are obvious or really and actually limited by the hardware. Others leave you scratching your head.

> Flyover and turn-by-turn navigation will be available only on iPhone 4S and iPad 2 or later.

This makes sense actually. I’m sure it requires a lot of horsepower under the hood.

> Siri will be available only on iPhone 4S and iPad (3rd generation)

I kind of understand this. Siri needs a really good mic, and horsepower.

> Shared Photo Streams requires iOS 6 on iPhone 4 or later or iPad 2 or later

Why?

> FaceTime over a cellular network requires iPhone 4S or iPad (3rd generation)

Why?

> VIP list and VIP and Flagged smart mailboxes will be available on iPhone 4 or later and iPad 2 or later.

Uh, WHY?!?

> Offline Reading List will be available on iPhone 4 or later and iPad 2 or later.

WHY?!? WHY?!? WHY??? Do you really enjoy irritating users Apple? I know that you don’t, so why? [1](#fn:leftbehindfn1)

> Made for iPhone hearing aids require iPhone 4S.

Not enough information to scream about this one.

Like I said, a couple of these make sense, and others… not so much.
