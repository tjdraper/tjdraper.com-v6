> Everything else stays the same, it seems: you can get up to 64GB of RAM, 2TB worth of solid state drives (but only running over SATA 3Gb/s), AMD Radeon HD 5770 and 5870 graphics cards (which we thought were out of production), 802.11n networking, Bluetooth 2.1, Gigabit Ethernet, optical digital audio in and out, a combo DVD writer, and a host of FireWire 800 and USB 2.0 ports (no USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt). It’s probably still a powerful machine, but if you were hoping Apple’s workstation would see the latest and greatest technologies, we’re afraid you’re out of luck for now.

This seems like an amazingly out of touch move on Apple’s part. Pros are not going to react well to this. My question: why did they even bother?
