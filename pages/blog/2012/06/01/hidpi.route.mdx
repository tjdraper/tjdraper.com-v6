Current Pixel Density
---------------------

One of the few things I actually dislike about my laptop is the screen. Don’t get me wrong, I like the screen well enough, it’s actually a beautiful screen. I have no problem getting it bright enough to see in bright environments. I ordered the matte screen so I don’t have any problems with glare. But the one thing that bugs me is the resolution. The pixels are not dense enough to call it a retina screen, but those pixels are definitely packed tighter than any display I have previously used. It’s a 17” screen with a native resolution of 1920 x 1200. That’s the same native resolution as the old aluminum 24” Apple Cinema Display. So same number of pixels in a smaller space. This makes the user interface and standard size of things pretty small.

User Interface Scaling
----------------------

Back in Snow Leopard I played a little with User Interface Scale because of this problem. I don’t remember the specifics, but there was a way to change the scale of the user interface while (in theory) making use of all the pixels. There were modes like 1.5x and 2x (2x should sound familiar if you are familiar with Apple’s Retina Display Technology). Problem was that nothing looked right in these modes. It was all still very much experimental and clunky. Window Widgets would look odd, strange lines would appear in the user interface in strange places. Some things were completely unusable. I gave it up as a bad job.

HiDPI Mode.
-----------

Lion, as I have recently discovered, has something hidden called HiDPI mode. If you have the developer tools installed, you can open the Quartz Debug app, and enable HiDPI display modes. After a log-out log-in, your display preferences will have HiDPI modes available.

This enables you to choose an effective UI resolution displayed in twice the number of pixels. I experimented.

The problem is that as I said before, the pixels on my screen are not quite dense enough to be called a retina display. Half of 1920 is 960. Switching to 960 x 600 HiDPI (essentially 2x) mode cuts my screen real-estate down to almost unusable proportions.

However, it is clear that Apple has refined this from what it was in Snow Leopard. Everything looked beautiful, except for third part apps that had images and UI elements not optimized for HiDPI 2x display.

Optimal Resolution
------------------

The optimal resolution for my taste on my 17” MacBook Pro is 1600 x 1000. Anything less feels too large (such as the 960 HiDPI 2x mode). The problem is that when not at native or 2x resolution, things looks a tad fuzzy. But I can see things much better. At 1920 x 1200 native, reading websites at standard size, or emails, the text is too small to be comfortable. A lot of things are just a tad too small to be comfortable.

Now the problem in turn is that if the optimal resolution is 1600 x 1000, then for 2x HiDPI (retina) you need a screen that is 3200 x 2000 pixels native in order to display an effective screen real-estate of 1600 x 1000. That’s a lot of pixels.

It will be interesting to see what happens in the next little bit.
