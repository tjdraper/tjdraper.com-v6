> We just got an invite in our inbox to an interesting Google event centered around Google Maps. The invite says we’re invited to an event that will show off The Next Dimension of Google Maps, so we’re betting its related to 3D.
> 
> The timing is interesting, considering that WWDC begins on June 11th, and Apple is expected to introduce its own Google-free Maps solution including ‘mind blowing’ 3D.

> This will play out the same way it always does: big competitor announces something the week before an Apple event to try to take the wind out of Apple’s sails, then Apple releases something similar or better, and everyone forgets about the competitor’s announcement.

> Does this move ever work?
