> The most infuriating thing I’ve found about the Podcasts app is that it marks episodes as played immediately. If you play an episode for even a few seconds the app will frequently mark the episode as completely played. This does not make much sense to me. Even the Videos app for iOS will mark episodes as partially played. I would think this is even more important for podcasts. Some episodes seem to show a partially played icon while others will not. It’s just not a very consistent experience.

> The most disappointing part of the Podcasts app to me is that there is very little iCloud sync. Apple says it will sync your play state between iOS devices, but I couldn’t get it to work. Also, leaving out Apple TV and iTunes desktop makes it less useful anyway.

> It’s also less than ideal that I can’t sync subscriptions between devices. It means I have to subscribe (or unsubscribe over time) to each show, on each device, over and over again. For a lot of podcasts on a lot of devices, that’s not user friendly.

> Considering iCloud is Apple’s own in-house cloud syncing solution, I am baffled at the fact that the Podcasts app doesn’t better integrate with it. Hopefully that’s near the top of the coming features list.

I’m not the only one scratching my head on some of this stuff.
