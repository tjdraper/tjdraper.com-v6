I meant to link to this a few days ago.

> It costs just $100 to double 4GB to the maximum 8GB of RAM on any of the models that start at 4GB, and just $200 to double 8GB to the maximum 16GB supported on the Retina MacBook Pro.

This is why people complaining about the soldered RAM just donâ€™t get it. For that price, I would just max out the RAM at order time and forget about it.
