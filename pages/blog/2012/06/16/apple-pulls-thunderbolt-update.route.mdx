> Apple has identified an issue with Thunderbolt Update 1.2 (released Monday, June 11th, 2012) which caused some Macs to become unresponsive on startup after the update was installed. Apple promptly withdrew the update and investigated, discovering an installation compatibility issue with a previous Thunderbolt update applied by some customers. Apple apologizes for the disruption this caused for customers with affected Macs.

Glad to see Apple acknowledge the issue frankly.
