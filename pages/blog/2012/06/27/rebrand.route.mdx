Welcome to phase one of a major re-branding effort. Goodbye Apple User Pro, hello BuzzingPixel. I never really cared for the name Apple User Pro, but I was uninspired for a name at the time. Then, a few weeks ago, BuzzingPixel came to me and I loved it. I asked a friend or two what they thought and they liked it. I proceeded with a logo design, which people I have asked have mostly loved. And I like it so there it is up there.

Re-branding will hopefully not be a major turn off to anyone since I don’t really have a lot of people following me (yet).

Phase two will be the rebranding of my business, Two Edge Media, to BuzzingPixel Creative. That should bring a little more unity to my online presence.

There are also some grand plans in the works for podcasting but that’s not quite ready to go yet. In the mean time, I hope you like the new site and new design.
