> Apple has pulled Thunderbolt Software Update 1.2 from its list of available downloads, MacNN has discovered. Although the update was only meant to add support for the Thunderbolt-to-Gigabit Ethernet adapter, some users have complained that it caused serious boot issues such as kernel panics or freezing at the gray boot screen.

I noticed this morning that the update was missing when Software Update popped up to tell me about some software updates and it was not among them. I expected it to be since I didnâ€™t have time to install it the first time it came up.

Good to see Apple pulled it.
