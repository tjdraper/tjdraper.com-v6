> Version 3.0 of Reeder for iPhone is a major update. Not only are there a slew of new features, but there are an equal number of design improvements. The app has been completely re-written from the ground up and every corner of the UI has been refined. In short, Reeder runs better, looks better, does more, and is easier to use.

Great review of a great iOS app. The only puzzling thing for me in the update was that none of the settings from 2.x were saved. I don’t get that at all. I understand why re-authentication with Google Reader would need to take place since things have changed with the way it interfaces with the Google API, but throwing out all the settings was a little bit much. But still, other than that it’s a great update.
