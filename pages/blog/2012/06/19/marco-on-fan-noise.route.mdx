> I had hoped that it would use lower-wattage CPUs or drop the high-powered GPU to reduce heat and noise, but Apple didnâ€™t do either, opting for maximum-performance components instead.

As a MacBook Pro user, and likely to be for some time to come, I for one am extremely glad they did not drop the high-powered GPU just to make it a little less noisy and less warm running. I need the high-powered GPU for my work. Yeah, it makes things run hotter, and the fan on my MacBook Pro often runs, and yeah, I hate the noise. But, I would not be able to function as well without the discreet GPU.
