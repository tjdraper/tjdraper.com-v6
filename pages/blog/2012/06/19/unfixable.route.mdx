I love linking to a linked list item on my own linked list.

> Bonnington — I think — is trying to imply that Apple built the new MacBook Pro with Retina display purposefully so it was difficult to repair. While I do think Apple doesn’t like people tinkering inside their machines, the company made specific tradeoffs to get this machine as thin and as light as it could. There’s nothing nefarious about that.

Yeah, and also, here’s the thing, Apple’s prices on upgrades to the base model at purchase time are more reasonable than they have ever been. 16 GB of RAM for $200.00? Count me in. I don’t love removing 80 screws and making sure I don’t damage the RAM with static electricity that much anyway. Just max the thing out if you’re that worried about it. Personally, I’m thrilled with what I know of the Retina MacBook Pro.
