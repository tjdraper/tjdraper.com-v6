And for some news I’ve been meaning to get to since before WWDC.

> It’s been pretty easy to look at recent Apple design patents and see that they haven’t carried with them the broad patent coverage many might think, but that isn’t the case with Apple’s new US patent — D661,296 — that issued on Tuesday. While a recent patent rumored to be on the Macbook Air design turned out to be a dud, covering only the bottom feet of the device, the ‘D296 patent is much different. This patent is clearly intended to broadly cover the distinctive wedge or teardrop profile of the notebook.

I don’t particularly blame Apple too much for patenting anything and everything they can, it’s sort of the patent culture we live in and if they don’t someone else will. But this is exactly the sort of thing that bugs me about our current system. They’re patenting _a wedge_ for crying out loud. It’s ridiculous.
