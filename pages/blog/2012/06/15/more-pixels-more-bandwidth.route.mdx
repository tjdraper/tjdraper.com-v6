Wow. I saw this article being talked about, and how utterly foolish it was so I bookmarked it for reading later. Insane. Completely and utter foolish drivel.

> CIOs with loose bring-your-own-device policies might find their corporate networks clogged should employees bring the just-announced Macbook Pro computers to work.

Why?

> …owners of devices with high-resolution screens might well consume more video and HD video, which would result in higher bandwidth consumption.

Huh?

> CIOs would thus do well to monitor network usage and make sure their employees aren’t watching too much high-definition content from YouTube and other video websites.

Because apparently watching YouTube videos on a retina display consumes more bandwidth than watching on a non-retina.

Wait, what?!? As I said, the blinding stupidity put forth here is incredible.
