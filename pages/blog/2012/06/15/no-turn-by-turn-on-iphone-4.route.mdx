> When Apple launches iOS 6 this fall, iPhone 4 users won’t be able to use turn-by-turn directions or Flyover in the new Maps application, as that functionality is limited to the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and third-generation iPad.

This is the sort of thing that I don’t get. I get why previous iPhones can’t do flyover, that looks graphically intensive. I’ve been using turn by turn directions via 3rd party app since my iPhone 3GS.
