> Well, first off, I can carry it around in my pocket and jot down notes throughout the day. I keep lists on it. There’s always a running grocery list. And you know what? I don’t lose this list.
>
> Right now we’re getting ready to go on a trip and I have check lists for everything that needs to be packed, or done before we leave. Hopefully this will cut down on pre-trip chaos and maybe I’ll get to come home to less of a disaster area. Maybe?

> As it turns out though, the coolest thing about the ipod is the kindle app. I haven’t gotten a lot of reading done since Garrett’s birth. Juggling a book and a baby while nursing isn’t an easy feat (unless you don’t mind ripped books), but the ipod fits in the palm of one hand and turning the pages simply requires swiping a finger (usually a thumb actually) across the screen. I’ve been downloading and reading free e-books like crazy.

She doesn’t even use it for music:

> Oh, and music? Well, ahem, any time I happen to go somewhere with my siblings, they ask if we can plug my ipod into the stereo and listen to some music. Maybe one of these days I’ll put some music on it so I can actually say yes to that request.

The times are a-changin’. Steve Jobs really was right. Computers are trucks, tablets, smartphones, iPod touches etc. are cars. Sure some people prefer to drive trucks and so they do. But most prefer to drive cars, even if they have a truck. They drive their car unless they have a specific requirement for a truck, a specific task. My sister obviously prefers to drive her “car” (iPod Touch) and use her “truck” (computer) when she has a need to do so.
