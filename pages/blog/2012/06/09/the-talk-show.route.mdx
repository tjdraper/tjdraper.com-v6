On May 18, 2012, John Gruber re-launched [The Talk Show](http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/) on [Mule Radio Syndicate](http://muleradio.net/). It caused a bit of a stir among the fan base. Previously, The Talk Show was a joint venture between Dan Benjamin and John Gruber. They did thirty episodes together at [TheTalkShow.net](http://thetalkshow.net/). That first iteration of The Talk Show sort of fizzled out. But Dan launched the 5by5 network. I wasn’t aware of The Talk Show or 5by5 at this time, but my understanding is that The Talk Show was a star podcast of the 5by5 network. This was the second iteration of The Talk Show and they did ninety episodes together. So that makes 120 episodes all together.

I was a regular listener for quite a while. I enjoyed the interaction between two Mac geeks. It was not just for Gruber the I tuned in.

I became aware that something was up the same way many did. The old “The Talk Show” Twitter account [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/thetalkshow/status/203557491664101377), and John Gruber retweeted, “Get Your Headphones on.” It was strange because that account has not been active for a while.

Then later The Talk Show tweeted, ““What If the Dolphins Had Thumbs?”, with special guest John “@moltz” Moltz: http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/1/”. I was concerned. Did “The Talk Show” leave the 5by5 network? Was Dan Benjamin out? Why no announcement? What was up? Why was this called Episode 1? Seemed to show disrespect to what came before. As a listener there was confusion and consternation.

There was quite a bit of action on Twitter, not a lot of long time listeners were happy. Most of us felt betrayed. Proprietor of Mule Radio Syndicate Mike Monteiro spent the day on Twitter mocking the fan base, making rude comments and suggestions, and generally berating us instead of providing any real feedback or answers to what was going on. It was a real turn off.

We liked both Dan and John, but it felt like John stuck a knife in Dan’s back. Or at least that’s the way I, and many perceived it — whether it was true or not.

In retrospect I think the signs were there that John was becoming disillusioned with The Talk Show on 5by5. He seemed dispassionate and laxidasical much of the time when talking to Dan. We listeners tended to overlook it as John’s personality, and some of it was. But I think there was tension forming looking back.

So why did many react so badly? Well I can tell you why I reacted badly. Firstly, I became a fan, not just of The Talk Show, but of 5by5. I liked John, but I also liked Dan Benjamin. And I felt that Dan was part of the show’s success. He helped keep it on track, he kept John from wondering too far off topic. The banter between two friends and co-hosts is what kept the show interesting and gave it the dynamic that made it a top rated show.

Just like kids don’t like it when their parents fight, podcast listeners don’t like it when their co-hosts don’t get along. And we often assign blame. I assigned mine to John, and I still mostly do. If John had been more forthcoming, if there had been one more 5by5 episode with an amiable parting, I would have been much happier.

I heard that John addressed that topic on episode 2 of the new Talk Show. So despite saying I would never listen, I did listen. He at least acknowledged that he handled the situation badly and that he made several mistakes. So I have put the show on probation.

We’ll see what happens I guess.
