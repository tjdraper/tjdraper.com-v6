> AT&T had the highest speed in all the tested cities, however performance was found to be wildly inconsistent depending on the time of day, with network congestion in the afternoons causing what CNN Money dubs a “crapshoot.”

This is just about right. I’ve clocked my AT&T HSPA+ service at very high speeds occasionally… very occasionally. About 1/3 of the time, I get very mediocre speeds, and 2/3 of the time I get really poor speeds. And that’s only counting the times I’m actually on 3G/4G. Because often, especially when traveling, 3G/4G is unavailable and it’s EDGE only.

> Verizon was also seen to have the quickest network response time, being twice as quick as AT&T, which is said to combine with consistency to make the network appear quicker.

It’s been a while, but I certainly remember the Verizon network being a lot more constant and reliable.
