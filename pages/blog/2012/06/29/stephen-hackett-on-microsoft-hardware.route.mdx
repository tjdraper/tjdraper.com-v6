Microsoft to Hardware Partners, “Hi… well this is awkward.” It is definitely an interesting shift though. Until now Microsoft has steered well clear of the PC hardware business. Their business model has pretty much been to sit back and let the PC vendors fight it out and race to the bottom while selling the software that powers the hardware to all of them. So this is indeed very interesting.
