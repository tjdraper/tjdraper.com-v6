> One of the problems that brought Apple in for a lot of criticism originated from that meeting. They displayed two timelines showing the same edit, one in FCP7 and a very tidier timeline in FCPX. From this it was assumed that older FCP7 projects could be opened in FCPX and we now know that that’s not directly possible. The two programs are completely different, we appreciate they don’t share a line of code but imagine a new PhotoShop from Adobe not being able to open old files.

Great article and a lot more here than this excerpt, but I thought that excerpt was worth pasting. That, along with what I’m pasting below is, I believe, two of the root problems with the way Apple handled the launch.

> So there you have it, a potted history of Final Cut Pro X. We don’t think there is anybody at Apple who won’t agree that the launch could have been handled in a way that could have stopped a lot of the criticism. Looking back over major transitions in Apple’s technology, OS9 to OSX and PPC to Intel for example, they both had overlap periods. The message was ‘This is new and cool and we would like you to move over, when you can,’ not ‘This is cool and you have no choice.

Exactly right. I like FCP X a lot, and I sure wish Apple hadn’t done themselves such a disservice with the way they handled this whole affair.
