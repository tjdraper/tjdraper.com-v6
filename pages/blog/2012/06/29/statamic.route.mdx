Flat files, no database, but still dynamic. I’ve looked at several of these types of systems from a distance, but none of them have appealed to me. This one however looks very interesting and I’m definitely going to keep my eye on it. Just digging around in the docs it looks like there is a way to do a lot of things I do with ExpressionEngine, and even templating looks closer to EE than other systems. I’m a huge ExpressionEngine fan (fan boy even perhaps?), but I will definitely keep an eye on this.
