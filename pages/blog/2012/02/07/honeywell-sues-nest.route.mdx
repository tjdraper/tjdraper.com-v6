Look, I don’t think from what I’ve heard Marco say about the Nest that I would like it. It tries to be a little too smart. But it is innovative. We need more competition. I’ve complained for years about standard thermostats, and even the new digital thermostats. They’re all stupid. At least Nest was trying to do something about it. But, oops, a stagnant company that can’t innovate it’s way out of a box is suing. What else is new?
