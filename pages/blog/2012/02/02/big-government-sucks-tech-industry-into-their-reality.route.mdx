You know, I think Michael Arrington is a scumbag most of the time. But so far, anything he has written that is remotely political, I have agreed with (and yes, this does sometimes keep me up at nightâ€¦ just kidding).

Take this piece for instance.

> Congress is the real winner here. They showed that they can and will pass bills that will cause irreparable harm to the tech industry just because Hollywood is willing to pay them off with huge lobbying dollars. And while SOPA/PIPA may be stalled for now, a big part of the reason is that tech companies got into the lobbying game, too.

I mean, everything he says in this article is just spot on.
