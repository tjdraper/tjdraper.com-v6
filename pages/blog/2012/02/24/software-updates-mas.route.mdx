> Updates to OS X Mountain Lion will be delivered through the Mac App Store, Pocket-lint says it has learned through one of the company’s private product briefings. Present and past versions of OS X have relied on a dedicated Software Update function. In switching to the Mac App Store for patching, Mountain Lion will mimic iOS’ App Store-based update system.

I hope that means all updates will be funneled through the Mac App Store. On Lion, who knows which of my software will be updated through Software update, and which not. For instance, my older copies of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which I downloaded from Apple’s website and installed manually, are updated through Software Update. Which has always been strange to me. It seems like Software Update’s purpose was to install updates to built in System Software. That model has been sort of stretched up until the Mac App Store to include any Apple Software. But if Apple just funnels everything through the Mac App Store, there will be much more cohesion.

This will be interesting though:

> Still unknown, though, is whether people will be required to sign up for an Apple ID. An account is normally mandatory for Mac App Store access, but some Mountain Lion owners could resent being forced to use an Apple ID for basic system functions.

I could see that being a problem. I don’t have a problem with it, but someone might.
