All of this looks pretty good. You have to respect Apple for their attention to detail.

A couple of my favorites:

> When you move a large file in the Finder, the file icon reflects the progress, just like when you install an app on iOS.

Sweet.

> Safari has a bunch of small refinements that make it easier to use. First, there’s a unified search bar and address bar, à la Chrome’s Omnibox. URLs are grayed out after the domain name, and the “http://” is stripped out as well.

Like.

> There are some pretty minor changes to Calendar and Contacts. In Calendar, the calendar’s drop-down menu is gone, replaced by a slide-out sidebar instead.

yes. Yes. YES!

I complained about the iCal calendar pop-over before in the footnote to this article: [Not condescending, but good](/article/2011/12/not-condescending-but-good#notcondescendingbutgood-fn1)

I’ll be glad to have the sidebar back. That pop-over is horrible to use, way too many clicks.

The one thing I’m not sure I like has to do with Safari:

> Tabs scale proportionally now, so if you have two tabs open, they’ll each take up half of the tab bar instead of a fixed width like before. This actually isn’t entirely new, as the Safari 4 beta did the same thing, though Apple axed the behavior before final release.

I liked Safari 4 Beta’s tabs on top, but not the proportional scaling. The _only_ think I like about Chrome better than Safari, is the tabs on top, and that they don’t scale proportionally. The problem with proportional scaling is that it breaks muscle memory.

I like everything else about Safari way better than Chrome so it’s not worth switching or anything. Perhaps Apple will acquiesce to put the tabs on top again at some point, and _not_ make them scale proportionally but I’m not holding my breath.
