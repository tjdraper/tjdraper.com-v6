> Apple sent out an interesting message to third-party developers today. iOS devs are now required to submit Retina display screenshots for their iPhone and iPod touch apps to the App Store. All updates to existing apps must also meet the 960×640 resolution requirement.

Make sense to me.

Also, file this in the “no kidding” category…

> After nearly 3 years, Apple could finally be ready to put the 3GS to bed. There’s no reason to keep selling an outdated phone that can’t even display App Store apps in their full resolution.

No, really?

> Here’s what I see happening in 2012: The 3GS gets the boot. The iPhone 5 (technically the sixth-generation version) takes the 4S’s place as Apple’s flagship smartphone. The iPhone 4S gets put in the sub-$100 price range and the iPhone 4 takes the place of the 3GS. Considering that the iPhone 4 is still one of the best handsets on the market, and the fact that Apple is leading the pack in market share growth and profits, I see no reason why the iPhone 4 couldn’t be offered for free with a carrier contract this year.

It’s like they can reach right into Cupertino and read the minds of Cook, Schiller, and Forstall.
