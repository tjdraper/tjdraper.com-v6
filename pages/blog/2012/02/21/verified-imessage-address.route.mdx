A friend of mine brought up a good point. In the new Messages for Mac Beta when you want to send an iMessage to someone, and you do not already have a conversation started with them, you click on the little “write” icon up on the left to start a new message. Then you must begin typing an iMessage capable Apple ID (email address) or the name of the person you want to send a message to. If you know the person’s iMessage Apple ID, no problem. But if you don’t know or don’t remember it can be confusing because as you type a person’s name, all the email addresses associated with them in your address book will be available as an option to click. However, there is a way to see which email address is associated with an iMessage Apple ID. As you type, and email address start appearing, those that are valid iMessage Apple IDs will have a little blue bubble next to them like this:

That little blue chat bubble on the right indicates the email in question is an iMessage capable Apple ID. It seems like Apple could make this a little more user friendly and apparent, but we are still dealing with a beta so we’ll see what happens.
