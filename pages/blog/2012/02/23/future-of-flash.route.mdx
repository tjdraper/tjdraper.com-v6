> More releases, more features, and more performance, are all planned, but on fewer platforms: Adobe is giving up entirely on supporting smartphone browsers, sticking to the core desktop platforms for its plugin

Who would have guessed. Oh wait, ME!

Yours truly on Flash:

**[It’s about time! →](/blog/2010/08/10/its-about-time)**

> Flash is a deplorable product and I avoid it all that I can!

**[News flash, “Flash really isn’t good for mobile devices” →](/blog/2010/08/23/news-flash-flash-really-isnt-good-for-mobile-devices)**

> I have said from the beginning that I simply do not want Flash anywhere near my iOS devices. I determined even before the iPhone that Flash was a curse upon the internet and have been employing flash blockers of various kinds for years on my desktop web browsers.

**[Flash on Android. Nope, not the droid you are looking for! →](/blog/2010/08/31/flash-on-android-nope-not-the-droid-you-are-looking-for)**

> I continue to maintain that if my phone was flash “capable” I would be looking for ways to block it as I do on my laptop browser.

**[Adobe Flash is a killer! →](/blog/2010/11/03/adobe-flash-is-a-killer)**

> …if we could completely eliminate Flash content from the web, said web would be a better place!

> I have no doubt that Apple would have included flash in iOS if it was viable for mobile platforms. But the fact is Flash has never been a particularly efficient technology. It used to serve its purpose. It was decent for desktop experiences at one time. But trying to shoehorn it onto the mobile platform where battery life and system resources are at a premium was always a bad idea. And Adobe has consistently proven that they are incapable of adapting Flash to mobile platforms.

> And the bottom line here is that Apple has not “won” because we aren’t transitioning from Flash (a proprietary web publishing platform owned by Adobe) to some Apple proprietary technology. Flash is being superseded by web technologies that are much better, and that are more open and standards driven. This is a win for everyone
