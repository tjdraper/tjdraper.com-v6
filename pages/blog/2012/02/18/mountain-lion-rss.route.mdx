> One thing you won’t find in Mountain Lion’s Mail app—at least as it stands today—is the RSS feature. Whereas in Lion you can subscribe to an RSS feed in Mail in order to be alerted to, and to read, newly published articles from your favorite websites, that feature appears to be gone from Mail in Mountain Lion. Mail’s preferences window has been stripped of the RSS pane, and there’s no longer an Add RSS Feeds command in Mail’s File menu.

> What makes this omission especially curious is that RSS functionality also seems to be missing from Safari in Mountain Lion. It appears that if you want to read RSS feeds in Mountain Lion, you’ll have to turn to a third-party app—at least, if nothing changes between now and the arrival of the final version of this OS X update in late summer.

I can’t say I’m shedding any tears. Apple’s built-in RSS tools have always been very lacking. I’ve used Google Reader for years, and more recently, I’ve been using [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) on both iOS and OS X, which is simply put, an app that works and syncs with Google Reader. The problem with RSS in Safari or Mail is that it only works in one place, on one computer.
