> In two report back in April and July of last year, we reported that Apple was working on an ultra-thin 15-inch Mac notebook, with the suggestion being that the existing MacBook Pro line would evolve to take design cues and many of the features from the popular MacBook Air. But whether the larger notebooks would be branded as MacBook Pros or MacBook Airs has been unclear.

Understand that I personally have no evidence for anything I’m about to say. I’m just guessing. But I also know how Apple operates. Time will prove me right or wrong. And [I’ve](/blog/2010/08/10/the-verizon-rumor-mill-is-yapping-again) [certainly](/blog/2010/08/23/the-verizon-drumbeat-grows-ever-stronger) [been](/blog/2010/09/23/a-verizon-iphone-not-so-fast) [wrong](/blog/2010/10/07/can-you-hear-me-now) [before](/blog/2011/01/12/verizons-dream-comes-true-so-does-mine).

However…

I think it is highly likely that all of Apple’s laptop line will resemble the MacBook Air with the next round of updates. I suspect that all new notebooks will no longer contain optical drives. This is key, I think, in moving the the MacBook Air like form factor. I will also predict that Apple will switch to all Solid State drives. It really does make a huge difference in battery life and computer performance.

Now, whether they will all be called the MacBook Air or not is up for debate. I am not sure it makes sense, at least not to me. What makes sense to me is to discontinue the 13" MacBook Pro, continue to call the 11" and 13" MacBook Airs the same, and call the new Air like form factor 15" and 17" notebooks MacBook Pros. As long as they continue to provide high powered CPUs and high RAM capability, the only thing you would really be loosing is the optical drive. I removed my optical drive and replaced it with an SSD anyway so that would suite me well.

Apple can be mysterious so the only thing we can really do beyond speculate as I have just done, is wait and see what happens.
