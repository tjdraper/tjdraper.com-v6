> Based on the text strings found in the App’s resources, it has been revealed that Messages will no longer be available for Lion users once the beta expires. Instead, Apple tells users to visit the App Store to purchase OS X Mountain Lion to continue to use Messages

This, if true, will tick a lot of people off — including me. I expect to have to pay for Messages for Lion at the end of the beta similar to the way they made FaceTime $0.99 when the beta expired. If I can’t get it at all on Lion it’s _really_ going to irritate me because I doubt I’ll be able to upgrade to Mountain Lion right away, being a professional and relying on my system as I do.

Come on Apple, you’re better than this!
