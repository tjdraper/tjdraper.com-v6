I [linked to this much earlier](/linkedlist/2010/09/os-xs-last-birthday-nope-dont-think-so) in Apple User Pro’s life, and at the time I didn’t have a Claim Chowder category (which I have even still been sadly neglecting). As such, I sort of forgot about it, didn’t check up on it. So this is way back talking about there not being a 10.7, much less a 10.8.

Still, with the announcement and first looks at Mountain Lion (10.8) it seems appropriate to point this out as failed claim chowder now.

> OS X 10.6 is the cherry atop the lovely sundae that is Apple’s latest operating system. It’s a fond farewell to a cat that’s grown rather long in the tooth, and I don’t think we’ll see a 10.7 in the series. Why? Apple has another OS it’s pushing, and it’s clearly serious about it. I’m talking about iOS of course, which recently got a name change that makes it much more platform agnostic than the original iPhone OS.

Here’s what I had to say [the first time I linked to it](/linkedlist/2010/09/os-xs-last-birthday-nope-dont-think-so):

> What a sensationalist load of garbage. Beside the fact that as it stands right now iOS would never work well on a full size computer, there is the fact that you have to have a Mac running Snow Leopard to develop for iOS. If Apple let’s the Mac platform stagnate, it’s iOS platform will also stagnate.

…

> I fully believe we will indeed see a 10.7, and even a 10.8. I could not speculate at this time what they will look like, and how much of the iOS feel OS X will take on, but there’s way too much going on with the full grown OS X platform to abandon it any time soon.

Looks like I was right. And I’m going to go on record now and say we will indeed see a 10.9, and another after that, though I don’t know what they will do for naming convention… 10.10? They’ve shown a willingness to do that after the third dot in the past. With 10.4 Tiger, they went all the way to 10.4.11. There’s no doubt there’s a lot of branding fuel behind OS X and it’s hard to imagine throwing that away. I give a good chance of them going to 10.10, 10.11 etc.
