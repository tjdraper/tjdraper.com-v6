Great iOS Apps
--------------

One of the things that I really love about iOS is the app explosion that has taken place. There are some first class third party apps for iOS out there. Some of my favorites are [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/), [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/iphone), [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/2/), and [Instacast](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast).

Honorable mentions, [Olive Tree Bible Reader](http://www.olivetree.com/iphone/) (although the auto play video on their site when I looked them up just now took them down a peg in my mind, horrible!), [Loose It!](http://www.loseit.com/), [Snapseed](http://www.snapseed.com/), [BeejiveIM](http://www.beejive.com/) (great app which I’m now retiring in favor of going all iMessage).

But one thing bothers me: sometimes these great apps don’t have OS X counterparts. Some do of course, such as Reeder. Reeder was pioneered on iOS and then made it’s way to OS X, and it’s awesome! I could not ask for a better RSS client that stays in sync across all my devices by syncing with Google Reader. Snapseed also just came to the Mac, though I haven’t tried that app on Mac yet.

But there are apps among these that I _really_ want an OS X counterpart for. Top of the list is Instacast.

### Instacast

Instacast is a great podcast client, and it uses iCloud to sync podcast subscriptions and playback positions between devices… _iOS devices_. But as much as I love iOS, and think that iOS is the future, the Mac is not dead, and will not be for a long time, if ever. The bulk of my work is done on my Mac. I would love to be able to pick up a podcast right where I left off on my iPhone, on my Mac.

### Tweetbot

Tweetbot is the best Twitter client, period. Not just the best on iOS, the best Twitter client of any platform combined. But there is no Mac client. I finally broke down and bought [Osfoora for Mac](http://osfoora.com/mac/), and it’s about the closest, but it is no Tweetbot. I would love for Tapbots to bring Tweetbot to Mac.

### Instapaper

Probably 80% of the things I post here go through Instapaper. Instapaper is awesome, the iOS app is _really_ awesome. But there is no Mac app. I’d pay at least as much or more for a Mac App as I did for the iPhone app. Right now, I’m using [Read Now](http://mischneider.net/readnowapp/), which has been pulled from the Mac App store apparently as I just found out when looking up the link, because of an infringement letter (doggone patent and copyright garbage again). In any event, even if Read Now were still available and being updated, I would switch to an official Mac Instapaper app in a cold minute.

It goes the other way too
-------------------------

There are some great apps on the Mac that I would dearly love to have on iOS.

### iBiz

[iBiz](http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibiz/index.php) is a great small business app that I use constantly on Mac, but I would love to have an iOS app that would sync with the Mac app.

### MarsEdit

Almost everything I post here goes through [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/). It’s a great desktop blogging application that works well with many blogging platforms, including (of course since I use it) ExpressionEngine. I have attempted to find a good blogging app for iPhone but I have not been able to do so, and I’ve tried several. I thought I had actually landed something good with [iExpression](http://www.rwe-uk.com/iexpression/app) made specifically for ExpressionEngine. But it turns out it’s nothing but a pain in the rear quarters. It never works the way it’s supposed to. Right now, if Red Sweater would make an iOS version of MarsEdit, I would buy it immediately.

### Mou

If I’m not writing in MarsEdit, I’m probably writing in [Mou](http://mouapp.com/). As far as I know, there is no iPhone equivalent. I would be very happy to see Mou come to iOS.

Please

So in conclusion, I would really love to see developers with a little more cooperation between Mac and iOS apps. So, dear developers, please?
