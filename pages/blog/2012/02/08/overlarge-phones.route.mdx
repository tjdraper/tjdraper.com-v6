I’ve been [making a bit of fun](/blog/2012/02/06/no-moon) at [the expense of](/blog/2012/02/07/galaxy-note-iphone) these big old Android phones. But here’s HTC admitting the problem.

> HTC “dropped the ball” on its 2011 devices, the company’s CFO has admitted, with LTE-equipped handsets simply too thick and offering insufficient battery life. Speaking on the company’s financial results call today, following HTC’s unappealing Q4 2011 results, Chief Financial Officer Winston Yung conceded that HTC had plenty of work to do improving both “design and components.”

I like [John Gruber’s take](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/06/whoops).

> I, for one, am shocked — shocked! — that big thick phones with poor battery life fared poorly.
