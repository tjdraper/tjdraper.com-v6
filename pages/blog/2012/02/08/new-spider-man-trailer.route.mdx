Am I the only one who thinks this is completely stupid? I love a good super hero movie, but the original Toby Maguire Spider-Man movie is only 10 years old. I don’t think a remake is in order just yet. Maybe I’m prejudiced as a fan of the Maguire Spider-Man movie series, but this really does seem ridiculous. Are there no new ideas we can bring to the big screen that we must remake perfectly good and perfectly modern movies?
