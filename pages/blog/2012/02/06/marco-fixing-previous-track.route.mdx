> I often accidentally hit the wrong button in the iPhone music-playback control bar, because they’re too close together since the introduction of AirPlay:

I actually had this problem before Airplay, and when the airplay button is present making everything scrunch together, it’s quite a bit worse.

I do agree with Marco when he says it’s a tricky design problem. And I’m not really sure that his proposed solution would work well. But it is definitely a problem for me. I am constantly pressing the forward or backward button when I mean to press pause or play. It’s a major thorn in my side.
