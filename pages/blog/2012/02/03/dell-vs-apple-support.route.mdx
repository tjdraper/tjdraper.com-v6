> Because getting the Apple gear repaired is so incredibly easy it’s freaky. There are three Apple stores in San Francisco. One is steps from a major transit hub and another has great parking. Take your pick. You make a reservation online, walk in with your busted product, have a little chat with nice person who speaks your language, and, for computers, leave the product with them. Two or three days later, you go back and get it, fixed.

> In the case of appliance products like iPhones, it’s even easier. In my case, I took in the phone and showed it to a blue shirt. He said, “Yup, that’s broken, just a minute,” went into the back, and returned with a new phone for me (actually a refurb, but a cosmetically perfect one). Total time in store: seven minutes. I timed it. (I include the time spent verifying that the tech wiped my old phone before I left it behind.)

Yep.

He does diss Apple hardware. He says:

> Now here’s the weird thing: I have had four of the six Apple products I’ve bought in the past few years fail: Two Macbooks (one, the DVD drive; the other, the screen latch magnets), an iPhone (power button), and this week, a MacBook Air (USB port). Why do I keep going back and buying Apple equipment when it should be obvious to me by now that the stuff has a comical failure rate?

This is just bizarre to me. I’m not sure what he’s doing to his Apple products. That has not been my experience at all. I have had _one_ lemon Apple product — my previous MacBook Pro — that I finally had the mother board replaced on (under warranty). That almost five-year-old computer is still in use by my dad. It’s a great computer for him. That and a swelling battery problem on my wife’s MacBook is about the extent of the problems I’ve had with my Apple gear (of which I have, and have had plenty).

In any event, despite what he perceives to be comical failure rate, he’s still hooked. Because Apple doesn’t just sell hardware, they sell service.
