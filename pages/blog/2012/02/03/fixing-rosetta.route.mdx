Following up on my earlier link about Rosetta problems in the latest Snow Leopard update.

> Restoring to a pre-Security Update 2012-001 Time Machine backup is ideal, but if you can’t do that the next best thing is to use a bandaid patch created by an [Apple Discussion Board user](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3706348) that restores Rosetta app functionality

I probably would not recommend this bandaid patch business. Ideally, if you have a Snow Leopard install hanging around because you need Rosetta, then **do not** apply this update until Apple has resolved the issues. If you already updated and have been bitten, then _perhaps_ this is worth a try. Again though, I don’t think I would recommend it or do it myself. Mixing in files from a previous system version to overwrite replaced files from the last update seems dangerous to me.

**If you do decide to try this, be certain to have a FULL BACKUP!**
