> While the odd “CUI Error” experienced by some users after upgrading to OS X 10.7.3 earlier this week has garnered a fair amount of attention, it appears that a security update released for Mac OS X Snow Leopard at the same time is also causing major issues for users who rely on older PowerPC applications that run under Apple’s Rosetta framework.

This is not good. I suspect there is a high probability that anyone still running Snow Leopard is doing so because they depend on Rosetta for some application or other. Apple should fix this **pronto**.
