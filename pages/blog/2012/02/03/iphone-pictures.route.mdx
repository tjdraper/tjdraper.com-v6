I’ve had the opportunity to work from home a lot lately. And Natasha likes to sit in my lap when she gets up from her nap. She doesn’t like to talk… no not at all. Just sit. And watch. And possibly scowl.

And then there’s schoolwork for big boys. ![IMG 1185](/images/uploads/IMG_1185.jpg "IMG_1185.jpg")

I try to take a long walk everyday to get some exercise (trying to overcome the effects of my mostly sedentary lifestyle). A couple days ago it was such a great day I couldn’t help but whip out my trusty pocket camera… er… iPhone, and snap a few shots.

Earlier today, I took 30 minutes to go to the park with my family.
