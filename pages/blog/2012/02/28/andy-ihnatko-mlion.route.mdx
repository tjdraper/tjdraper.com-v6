> 2012 could prove to be one of the most interesting showdowns of ideologies in the history of computing. With Mountain Lion, Apple’s underscoring the point they made with Lion last year: a mobile device should run a mobile OS and a desktop/notebook should run a desktop OS … but there should be a pipeline of ideas between the two. That pipeline has been unidirectional so far, but maybe that’s the natural consequence when one OS is so much fresher than the other.

A good overview and fun read.
