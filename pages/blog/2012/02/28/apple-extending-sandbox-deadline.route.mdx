> We have extended the deadline for sandboxing your apps on the Mac App Store from March 1st to June 1st to provide you with enough time to take advantage of new sandboxing entitlements available in OS X 10.7.3 and new APIs in Xcode 4.3.

Translation: We know thereâ€™s issues with the current implantation of Sandboxing. We hope to add a couple more entitlements to the woefully short list to appease you and then implement it rather than really beefing up the idea of Sandboxing and making it work for everyone.
