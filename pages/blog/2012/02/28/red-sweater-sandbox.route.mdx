> Apple should **embrace the utility of sandboxing** by shifting their focus away from sandboxing only Mac App Store titles, to a strategy that would sandbox virtually every Mac app, inside the store or out. Given the current limitations of sandboxing, a significant number of developers will not adopt the technology, so its usefulness to users and to the security of the platform will be diminished. Apple can turn that around so that sandboxing is a worthy counterpart to Gatekeeper, and a technology that any developer in his or her right mind would feel foolish not to incorporate.

A really good and thoughtful take on Sandboxing. As it is, Apple is completely blowing it. The frustrating thing is the concept is really good and Apple could make it great.
