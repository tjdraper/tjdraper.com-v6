Apple is apparently not having a good round of updates. The Snow Leopard Security update is [causing some problems with Rosetta](http://appleuserpro.com/linkedlist/2012/02/rosetta-update-issues). And there have been [reports of problems with using Software Update](http://9to5mac.com/2012/02/02/heres-the-fix-for-intermittent-cui-errors-following-the-10-7-3-update/#more-135838) to update to 10.7.3.

I was not affected but then, as is my usual practice, I downloaded the [Combo Updater](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1484) and updated all my Macs with that. I do this because I have several Macs to update and itâ€™s just easier to download once and install on all systems from there. Not to mention I keep the latest Combo Update on my Boot/Recovery drive so I can get back up to speed quickly if I have to restore a system. Apparently, the Combo Updater did not suffer the problems the standard Software Update version did.

In any event, this is a little bit sloppy for Apple and quite unusual. I hope this is not a trend.
