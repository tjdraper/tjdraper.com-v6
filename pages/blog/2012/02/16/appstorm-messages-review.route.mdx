> If the Messages beta has shown me one thing, it’s that this is what Apple has been moving toward since they began reinventing these services. It completely unifies the experience of communicating on an Apple product, beginning with the interface.

Good review. My only quibble:

> Sure, I downloaded the FaceTime app, but I didn’t see why I’d ever use it for Mac-to-Mac when I can make video calls in iChat.

I have actually never been able to get iChat to reliably make video calls. Most of the time I would get “Communication Errors” on trying to connect. FaceTime on the other hand has yet to fail for me. I don’t know what all is different about FaceTime’s protocols versus the old iChat AV protocols, but it works _far_ better.
