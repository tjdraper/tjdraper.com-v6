> Yes, Leslie’s cartoon is a joke. But it hits the truth of what’s going on in the current smartphone arms race. With each new smartphone, companies like HTC, Samsung, Sony, and Motorola raise the bar by upping the screen size. The thinking that a 4.3inch screen is better than a 3.7inch screen is flawed, because it means each screen that is bigger, is better. It’s not.

Yep.
