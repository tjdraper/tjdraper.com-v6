This really is sickening:

> A 23-year old student from Sheffield Hallam University in the north of England is bound for America. That wouldn’t be unusual—except that Richard O’Dwyer won’t go voluntarily. The UK Home Secretary has today agreed to extradite O’Dwyer over US copyright infringement charges for running a “linking site” called TVShack.

Okay, so this guy wasn’t hosting pirated content. He wasn’t doing anything except linking to videos online.

> O’Dwyer’s site was a “linking site” that did not host infringing content itself, and his lawyer compared it to Google, which also links to copyrighted content. TVshack did do things like show lists of the most clicked-on links.

I mean this really is disgusting that we (the U.S.) are extraditing him to charge him for linking. This is insane. We are now spreading this insanity beyond our borders. Sometimes I am ashamed to live in this country.
