> Tim Cook announced an updated version of the Apple TV today, able to support 1080p HD video and coming with increased compatibility for a variety of Apple offerings. The new Apple TV will be released next week on March 16 and is [available for pre-order](http://store.apple.com/) starting today at the same $99 price point as its predecessor.

I know a lot of folks were expecting a Apple branded TV or something, and while I think Apple could bring something to that market, that’s not what we got… at least not yet. This appears to be a good, but evolutionary upgrade to the Apple TV.
