With the announcement of the new iPad yesterday, Apple broke with convention for iOS devices. Until now, iOS devices have had unique names with each update. We have had:

-   iPhone
-   iPhone 3G
-   iPhone 3GS
-   iPhone 4
-   iPhone 4S
-   iPad
-   iPad 2

But yesterday’s iPad, despite all previous indication and conventions in the naming of iOS devices that it would be the iPad 3, or possibly the iPad HD, it was simply called iPad, or the new iPad, or occasionally the third-generation iPad. While I think this is incredibly irritating there is, I believe, a couple of reasons for it.

First, iOS devices have been unique in this regard, and I suspect Apple was starting to get nervous about the naming of these devices. They can’t just keep adding a number every year or it would start to get silly. iPad 23 just doesn’t have the same ring. And it’s hard to come up with a new unique name every year such as iPad HD, or even iPad 2S because that sounds incremental (I’ll get to that in a minute). All other Apple products retain one name even with updates. The MacBook Pro has been through some very big and breathtaking changes and has always remained simply, MacBook Pro. Same with the iMac and Mac Mini. So I think Apple felt that it would be a good idea to go this route with iOS devices.

Second, I think Apple felt really burned by the naming of the iPhone 4S. Despite indications that Apple doesn’t really feel the need to keep with a full number change with every devices (3G, 3GS) folks expected iPhone 4S to be named iPhone 5. It wasn’t and tech pundits everywhere converged to talk about the disappointment that was iPhone 4S. Mediocre, device though it was not, the name had writers in a tizzy. And though the iPhone 4S is a great product that is selling by the truck load every minute, no one likes to hear their product dissed, and simply because of a name. I mean, what features would folks have expected to be different in an iPhone 5 that wasn’t in the 4S?

Third, Apple has a tendency to simplify everything it can, sometimes to a fault. I think Apple’s eyes were opened to the complication based on points one and two. Why not simply call it an iPad, it’s simpler.

Fourth, it makes it harder for someone to point out that your iPad is a generation or two old and cause you dissatisfaction with your device. If it’s just called the iPad, and doesn’t look significantly different from version to version, then simply calling it, the iPad is another way to provide customer satisfaction. And Apple wants their customers to be satisfied. Apple is a customer centric company.

All these things make sense, but I still fault them for it. It’s mostly just me griping, but I find it frustrating. It will now be harder for me, a geek/nerd, to identify the different models of iPad (and probably iPhone because I expect them to do the same for iPhone). I will now have to say, 2012 iPad, or third-generation iPad. I can’t say, iPad HD, or iPad 3.

But, Apple will be Apple, and this is the way they’ve decided to go.
