[![IMG 1306 small](http://appleuserpro.com/assets/uploads/IMG_1306-small.jpg "IMG_1306-small.jpg")](http://appleuserpro.com/assets/uploads/IMG_1306.PNG)iOS 5.1 has an interesting feature for those with an iPhone 4S on AT&T. Magically, after the update, the cellular data indicator now shows 4G. However, lest you think Apple unlocked some secret feature in that iPhone, nothing has actually changed except that icon. What’s really going on here is Apple bowing to AT&T marketing. And while I will say that AT&T has reason to push their HSPA+ as 4G. But I think it’s all pretty stupid.

It started with T-Mobile. You see, T-Mobile didn’t have a 4G strategy. But, T-Mobile’s (and AT&T’s) chosen 3G network technology standard, UMTS, has received several key advancements over the years. The advancement that T-Mobile began enhancing their 3G network with, often referred to as HSPA+ allows for theoretical peak speeds of 22 Mbit/s. T-Mobile began pushing this as “4G speeds.” At first they were careful not to actually call it 4G. And at the time, the standards body that governs these things did not call it 4G.

But eventually, T-Mobile marketing spin got the better of them and they began calling it straight up 4G. This ticked a _lot_ of people off who knew better. But no one was more ticked than AT&T who immediately launched a campaign to point out that this was not 4G, but really fast 3G. But then [the standards body changed their mind](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2374564,00.asp). HSPA+ could now be called a 4G technology. As AT&T had just begun rolling out this evolved form of UMTS, they also began branding their network as 4G. A lot of tech nerd types still refuse to acknowledge that HSPA+ is a 4G technology, and many more just spout that out without knowing one way or another, but they heard it somewhere from some nerd so they just say it.

I must admit that while I think it’s stupid, it can now be called 4G. And AT&T has to do it because a). T-Mobile is calling the same technology 4G and they have to compete, and b). the standards body now calls it 4G.

So: 4G.

However, when the iPhone 4S came out and supported the more evolved flavor of UMTS now called 4G, iOS did not recognize or call it such. The data indicator next to the network name still said 3G. The reason for this, at least to me, is fairly simple. It’s the same technology, and the iPhone didn’t differentiate, only that any time it was connected to a network of this type, it was 3G. So that’s what the iPhone called it.

The day the iPhone 4S was announced, AT&T began talking about how they were talking to Apple about the 4G branding. This appears to be the culmination of those talks, and the apparent winning of those talks by AT&T.

Unfortunately, I think this is/will be somewhat confusing to end users who don’t know anything about this technology. They updated their phone and now it says 4G. They will likely think Apple unlocked some magical 4G thing on their iPhone.

As you can see there is definitely some confusion. That’s why I think this whole thing is just silly. The bottom line is nothing has changed except the indicator and this is just a branding war for AT&T.
