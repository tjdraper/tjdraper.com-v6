> Priced at $14.99, Lion-compatible Quicken 2007 for Mac is available either by direct download or on CD.

…

> Intuit’s lack of support for the Quicken for Mac product line has sent customers searching for alternatives, with a number of other products such as iBank and Intuit’s own Mint.com seeing some success in the market, although each of the products offers a slightly different set of features.
> 
> Intuit is clearly trying to keep some of its Quicken for Mac customers using the software under Lion, but it is unclear whether the company has a long-term plan to advance a Quicken product for Mac that offers features beyond those found in Quicken Essentials. Given that even the Quicken 2007 for Mac page recommends that new Quicken users opt for Quicken Essentials, it appears that the company is still planning to push the stripped-down Essentials package as its primary Mac offering for at least the time being.

I highly recommend that you stay away from Quicken for your important financial data. Go with [iBank](http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/). I highly recommend [iBank](http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/).
