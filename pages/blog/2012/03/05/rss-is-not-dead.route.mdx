> Every time I hear someone on a podcast say that RSS is dead I can’t help but think about how podcasts are distributed via RSS.

It is pretty funny. I may be one of the last hold outs that actually uses RSS to keep up with stuff. I use [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) for iOS and Mac, which syncs with Google Reader.

But even if I stopped using RSS in that way, RSS would not be dead. Mark it up as claim chowder if you want, but I say RSS will never be dead. It’s use just changes. It’s use is always changing. And in the instance of subscribing to a podcast, you are subscribing to an RSS feed. And for folks who use Twitter as the new RSS, how do you think most websites post links to items on Twitter? Most websites automate that via the RSS feed.

RSS is far from dead.
