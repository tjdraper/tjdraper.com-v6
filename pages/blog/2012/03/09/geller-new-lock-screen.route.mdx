> Apple, your new lock screen is terrible. It’s great that you want to make the camera even more accessible in iOS 5.1 since a lot of people didn’t know the double-tap trick, but you’ve compromised the usability of something as simple and vital as unlocking a phone.

I really don’t understand what the problem is. I have not yet once accidentally tapped the camera button when sliding to unlock. It’s in an entirely different place, you have to swipe up for the camera from the right side of the screen. Sliding to unlock starts at the left side of the screen. The presence of the camera button has simply not affected my muscle memory at all. And the new camera button swipe is much easier and quicker than the previous “double tap the home button, click the camera button”.

> It’s too narrow for the space and I’ve tapped the camera button by mistake more than a few times trying to unlock the phone.

Seriously, I don’t even understand how this is possible. How do you accidentally tap the camera button on the right of the screen when 5 years of muscle memory send your thumb or finger to the left side of the screen.

Honestly, I think some people look for things to gripe about. I don’t get it. I think the new lock screen is awesome.
