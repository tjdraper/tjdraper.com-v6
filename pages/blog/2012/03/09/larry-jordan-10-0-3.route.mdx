> In the second part Larry digs into multicam editing.

This was a while ago in Internet time, but I just got around to watching the video(s). Larry’s walk through of the new features is excellent. All the new features are great, but the stand-outs to me were chroma keying and multi-cam.

Honestly, chroma keying looks better in FCP X than Keylight in After Effects. I used Keylight only a couple weeks ago on a project and I had a little trouble with frizzy hair. It looked much more manageable in FCP X chroma keyer. I’ll have to get FCP X’s chroma keyer into a real world situation, but it looks really good.

And of course, multi-cam in FCP X looks like everything I wanted in FCP 7 and maybe more. Again, I can’t wait to get FCP X into a real world situation.
