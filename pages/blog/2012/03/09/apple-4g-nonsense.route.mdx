Regardless of the stance you take on whether HSPA+ is truly 4G or not, whether you acknowledge the standards body’s waffling on the definition, whether you even care personally, it seems like Apple has indeed stirred a hornet’s next up by rebranding the 4S for AT&T with a 4G data indicator.

Well I have a way that Apple could have avoided the whole thing, how AT&T still could have called it 4G, and Apple wouldn’t have been in the middle. In fact, Apple already does it in one case. When an AT&T iPhone is on AT&T’s non-3G network (which is still alarmingly frequently for me), the data indicator displays “E”. E stands for EDGE. EDGE stands for **E**nhanced **D**ata Rates for **G**SM **E**volution. Now, technically, this is a 3G technology, but AT&T never branded it as such because it is _barely_ a 3G technology. Most people call it 2G, sometimes refer to it as 2.75G and on and on. Apple smartly avoided this by simply displaying “E” for EDGE. Most people didn’t and don’t know what this means and most don’t care. They just know that when their iPhone displays the “E” data symbol, things are going to be pretty slow.

So instead of getting involved in the firefight, why couldn’t Apple have replaced the 3G logo with the letter “H” when connected to AT&T’s HSPA network. Then “H+” for HSPA+. This avoids any firestorm and confusion. AT&T can tell their customers that when the phone says H+ it’s connected to a 4G network, and Apple isn’t involved with slimy marketing.

They could similarly use “L” or even “LTE” for LTE. And for Verizon EVDO (Verizon’s 3G) they could use EV. Plenty of other phone manufacturers do just that.

Now, I know that Apple probably would never do this, I’m surprised they even did it with EDGE (although I don’t know what else they would have done in that case). Apple doesn’t want the customer to care about the underlying technology. Most customers have been trained to look for how many “G” the phone has. But I submit that either way the customer doesn’t really know or care. They just learn to associate speed with whatever is displayed.
