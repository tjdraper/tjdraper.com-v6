Sometimes it’s the small things that I get excited about. One thing that has bugged me for many years, but was too small for me to blog about, or even mention on Twitter (at least I don’t think I ever mentioned it on Twitter), is the fact that when you open Safari on iOS and no windows are currently open (because you closed them all), then Safari would bring up the bookmarks list.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I love that iCloud syncs all my bookmarks between iOS and OS X and it’s great to have access to all those, but I find that rarely when I open Mobile Safari do I want to access a bookmark. More often than not I want to type a URL into the URL bar OR do a Google search. But Safari (un)helpfully brings up the bookmarks instead, which I must them close, then I have to click in the URL entry area or the Google search area before I can start typing.

As I said, this is a minor annoyance but it sort of like death by a thousand cuts since I often perform this action multiple times a day. And most of the time I close Safari windows I don’t need anymore so Mobile Safari always has no windows open when I bring it up, therefore: bookmarks.

iOS 5.1 has brought a welcome change. I can of course still click my bookmarks as ever, but no longer does Safari bring up that bookmarks list automatically that I must close before I enter the URL. There is much rejoicing on my end believe me! This is one of those welcome refinements that Apple is always working on and honing.
