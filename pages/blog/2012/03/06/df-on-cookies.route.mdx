> What the WSJ discovered is that Google (and a few other ad networks) found a way to store third-party cookies in Safari and Mobile Safari even when the option was set only to accept cookies from visited websites, as it is by default.

This article from John Gruber is a thoughtful take on the recent blow up with Google on cookies in Safari. I agree with Apple’s default because, personally, any browser I use with any regularity, I set the preferences to block third party cookies anyway. Most users don’t know and don’t care what cookies are so the default settings are important.

And the article John links to and quotes from keeps contrasting Safari against “The Open Web” whatever that means. John ably picks this nonsense apart but I just have to say, having a default setting to block cookies from sites that you are _not_ visiting is not “breaking” the “open” web. I love this from John:

> So Safari isn’t part of the “open web” because it doesn’t allow ad networks to track users across websites by default? Used to be that all major browsers allowed websites to create pop-up (and pop-under) windows for advertising; are browsers that block such pop-ups by default not part of the “open web” as well?

I will also say this regarding John’s footnote:

> It would be interesting to know what this setting defaulted to on the original iPhone back in 2007, when Apple and Google were buddy-buddy and Eric Schmidt even got to come on stage during the iPhone introduction and talk about what great corporate friends Apple and Google were.

I can attest that all versions of Safari have always defaulted to blocking third party cookies. Apple has always cared about their user’s privacy. This makes sense since they are in the business of pleasing customers, not (for instance) pleasing advertisers as is the business model of some companies.
