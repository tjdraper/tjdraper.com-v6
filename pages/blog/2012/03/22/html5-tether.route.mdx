> Unlike any other tethering solution (unsupported or otherwise) out there, Tether’s new app is entirely web-based. You don’t need to buy the app in the App Store or the jailbreak Cydia store. It creates a wireless connection over AdHoc that any device can connect to.

Go watch the video. This is an interesting use of HTML 5. I approve. I don’t need the HTML5 version right now though because I got the app while it was available for a short time from the app store and so am happy tethering over USB for now… Until Apple updates iOS in such a way that breaks compatibility with this app (since Apple pulled it and it won’t be able to receive updates).
