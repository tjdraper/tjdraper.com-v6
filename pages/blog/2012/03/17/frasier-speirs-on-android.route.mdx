> The Android platform is currently stuck in second gear because Google, their OEMs and the carriers can’t, won’t or simply have no incentive to get the installed base past the Android 2.x API set. There are better and more powerful APIs in Android 4, and there will be better ones again in the future, but developers can’t take advantage of them because almost nobody is running the latest OS.

> With iOS, you get updates direct from the source. Apple ships updates to any device for the period in which they’re being supported. At the moment, this is usually three years or more for iOS devices: the iPhone 3GS from 2009, the 3rd generation iPod touch from 2009 and all iPads can currently run iOS 5.

> Right now, the Android platform looks stalled in the marketplace at Android 2.x. Android 2, coupled with vague promises of future upgrades seems to ‘good enough’ for most carriers and OEM manufacturers. Even Sony just launched their Experia S phone with Android 2.3 and a promise to upgrade to Android 4 in Q2 2012 (we’ve heard that one before).

Worth a read. A good and thoughtful take on what’s going wrong with Android.
