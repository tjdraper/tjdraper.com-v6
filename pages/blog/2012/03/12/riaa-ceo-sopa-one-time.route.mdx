> When Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information, but then exploit their stature to present information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations… The conventional wisdom is that the defeat of these bills shows the power of the digital commons. Sure, anybody could click on a link or tweet in outrage - but how many knew what they were supporting or opposing? Would they have cast their clicks if they knew they were supporting foreign criminals selling counterfeit pharmaceuticals to Americans?

I think it is so self-evident how idiotic this is that I don’t feel the need to comment beyond this…

But I will just post this from the article which came right after that quote.

> Talk about a “self-serving political declaration.” To me, that sounds a lot like Mr. Sherman isn’t a big fan of informing the public. Better to let everyone believe that opposing SOPA is the equivalent of supporting foreign criminals.

Yep.
