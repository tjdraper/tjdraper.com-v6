> AT&T in remarks confirmed what should be a long, gradual transition away from GSM and EDGE networks. Company letters, as well as official commentary to MarketWatch, warned customers that their 2G-only devices might lose coverage partly or entirely in “certain areas” of New York City over time. Customers weren’t being required to switch, but they were being given free upgrades to 3G-capable devices that would normally have a small contract price, such as the Samsung Evergreen.

AT&T’s network is such a patchwork quilt. So now, on top of running 3 different network technologies — GSM, UMTS, and LTE — there are going to be some areas that only support the two newer technologies — UMTS and LTE — some areas that support all three, some that support only the older 2 — GSM and UMTS — and some that support only the oldest of the 3 — GSM.

Does anyone else have a headache?

You can fault Verizon for having the slower network if you want, but they’ve been very consistent. They’ve run CDMA/EV-DO for years and years. Now that they’ve finally run out of life in that network, they are pushing hard to overlay their entire footprint with LTE. They’ve even stated that as their goal. AT&T has stated no such goal. So with Verizon, once the entire network is overlaid with LTE, they’ll then be in a nice position to start end-of-lifing the CDMA network. The two will operate side by side for a while to come, no doubt. Having two network technologies running at the same time seems reasonable as you bring in the new network and get it up to speed. But three seems like a real problem. And what will AT&T do when 5G comes on the scene? Run 4 network technologies because they never finished rolling out 4G, just like they haven’t finished rolling out 3G? This seems very problematic to me. If they had finished rolling out 3G (UMTS), and had started requiring all handsets to be 3G capable much, much earlier than they did, they would be in a better position to start bringing about the end-of-life of the GSM network as they now gear up for 4G.

In a nutshell, AT&T’s network strategy seems insane to me.
