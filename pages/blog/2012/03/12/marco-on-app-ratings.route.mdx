> Effectively, apps that have embedded webviews that potentially could show inappropriate content to children need to be rated 17+ for “Frequent/Intense Mature/Suggestive Themes”. This warning is displayed prominently to people buying the app.

…

> Back in 2009, Instapaper caught a 17+ bullet and I was forced to add a 17+ rating for “Frequent/Intense Mature/Suggestive Themes”.
> 
> I got a lot of emails from angry or confused people who saw that rating and thought my app was full of hardcore sex. (Can you blame them, given how it’s worded?) Some were scared to install it because they didn’t want to get in trouble at work. Some were scared that my app would corrupt their children. Many others just didn’t want to see offensive material themselves. I lost a lot of potential customers.

I have always thought this policy, and it’s inconsistent enforcement was a stupid thing for Apple to do. Why does the iPhone itself not come with a 17+ rating then? The iPhone has a web browser capable of accessing the entire world wide web, what’s wrong with them for not putting a big fat warning sticker on the box?

To rate an app that is capable of displaying any content on the internet as 17+ is perhaps one of the more irritating things Apple has ever done.
