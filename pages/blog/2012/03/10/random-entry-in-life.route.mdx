Allen and Natasha really seem to like washing dishes. So sometimes we let them have at it…

Titus usually just watches from his chair while he snacks on something.

We had apparently a pretty big storm a few days ago. Electricity was flickering, tornado sirens were blazing, storm warnings everywhere. We didn’t get much rain until later in the day after all that fuss had died down, but we did get some ominous looking clouds.

Titus has been learning to brush his teeth.

My office has been ever moving for a while now. For several years I had an entire room in the house for my office space. But as we have more kids that’s becoming not very workable so we’ve been working on getting that room into shape for a bedroom. I moved my office to a corner of our _very_ small living room where I mostly contained myself to a corner desk. Then we re-decorated our living room, inherited a few bookshelves and a desk, and I contained myself to a smaller space. But as I have been working from home a lot lately I have discovered I do have a need to shut the door and be free of kid distractions from time to time. As much as I like letting the kids be around while I work, sometimes it just doesn’t… work. So we redecorated our bedroom. We got a closet organizer so we could put more stuff in the closet and move a dresser out to put a desk in it’s place.

This is the spring where we get our drinking water. I just don’t like drinking the city water. I like drinking water out of the ground as God intended…

For quite a while now we have had an ever ballooning water bill. At first we chalked it up to increased water usage. But it was becoming apparent that this could not be the case. The straw the broke the camel’s back was the water bill that came last week. We apparently used 27,000 gallons over a 30 day period. I finally realized we must have a leak somewhere. We thoroughly checked the house. No leakage.

The only place that leak could be was between the house and the water meter at the curb. So with the help of some awesome friends, we began digging. We found the leak at an elbow about 150’ underground (okay maybe I’m exaggerating).

Titus likes it when mommy makes cookies. Because, you know: COOKIE DOUGH!

And that’s pretty much all the randomness I have right now.
