> I’ve been using the developer preview edition of Windows 8 on a multitouch tablet for a few months, and now I’ve been using the new consumer preview for a little less than a day. My overall opinion is so high that it has to be stated right here in the first paragraph: Microsoft has really cracked something here. With the Metro user interface, they’ve created a simple and beautiful design language that’s relevant to a broad range of devices and to the ways that people use computers in the second decade of the 21st century.

A fair review of the upcoming Windows 8. I have not used it, but I continue to hear good things. Though Microsoft’s strategy is far different, perhaps someone is finally stepping up to provide some good competition for Apple. And I love competition, it’s always good for me as a consumer.
