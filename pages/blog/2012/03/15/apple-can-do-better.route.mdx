> I love Apple products and the Apple mindset in general. I devour Apple-centric content and I live in the Apple ecosystem. I can sum up my love for Apple with six words: their products dramatically improve my life. (Fun game: try that sentence with any company, and see if it rings true.)

> But nobody’s perfect. Here are a couple of specific things I wish Apple products did better, that I haven’t really heard others discuss. (Maybe they just have the good manners not to whine in public? But I digress.)

His first complaint, that iPhone does not gracefully switch data sources is right on in my experience as well.

> 1.  Product: iPhone. Issue: Gracefully switching data sources. Example: I throw my bag over my shoulder, pop my headphones in, and fire up some streaming radio for the morning commute. As I leave my house, my 4S is still on my home wifi network. I walk downstairs and hit the sidewalk. Somewhere between ten steps and two blocks later, my streaming radio cuts out. If I look down at my phone, I see the wifi icon stubbornly holding on to one dot of coverage - coverage it doesn’t even sense anymore, but is reluctant to inform me about - and then, begrudgingly, the “3G” icon appears to take its place. Sometimes my stream restarts, sometimes it doesn’t.

Yep. My iPhone will often stubbornly refuse to switch away from wi-fi even when I have far exceeded the range of wi-fi coverage. This has been an annoyance for me as well for some time.

I disagree with his fix though.

> My fix: A slider, in settings, letting me choose a preferred signal strength threshold when I have more than one data source available. If I have anything less than decent wifi, I want to be on 3G (or LTE, in the future). I don’t want to wait until every last morsel of my wifi connectivity is gone before I switch. In a perfect world, the threshold selector would allow for overlap, so that, beneath say 75%-strong wifi, the phone automatically started using 3G data to supplement the signal.

This will never work in the real world. Having this setting available to most users would not be good. They would have no idea how to configure it. In fact, I don’t even want to fiddle with it. I just want Apple to make it work and switch gracefully all on it’s own.

He also goes on to talk about the problem have switching devices and using multiple devices. Good stuff.
