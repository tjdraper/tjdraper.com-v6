> I did, however, spend a whole lot of my time with the XPS 13 fighting its terrible touchpad. It’s a single-button Cypress unit — no dedicated mouse buttons here — and the surface actually feels pretty good: unlike the tacky glass of the Razer Blade, it’s easy to glide a finger across the soft-touch surface, and it’s just as easy to physically depress the button as it is on the MacBook Air.

> The problem is that the Cypress drivers are all over the place. I tried three different versions of the software and manually tweaked every setting I could, and couldn’t find a single combination that both allowed for smooth two-finger scrolling and decent palm rejection. The pad is sensitive enough and close enough to the keyboard that it’s almost impossible not to hit it as you type, and the software’s not always smart enough to keep you from jumping a line when you do. There’s no way to easily and quickly turn off the touchpad while you’re typing, and scrolling can be exceptionally jerky, too. Also, no matter which version of the software I used, the Cypress pad was sluggish to respond to gestures like scrolling, pinch-to-zoom, and tap-to-click, which meant that the laptop only did what I told it to do after a noticible delay. Eventually, I gave up and switched to a mouse. I suspect you’d do the same.

Sometimes it’s hard to step out of the beautiful Apple garden and look out across the barren computer landscape. I even remember these sorts of trackpad problems with my first laptop, a non-Apple Windows computer of some sort. I tried all kinds of different drivers to get the trackpad to a usable state and never managed it.

This is to me, in a nutshell, exactly what is wrong in the world of Windows. Who wants to fiddle around with drivers for a trackpad, the most basic function of a laptop. It is precisely because the hardware makers and the software makers have been segregated that this happens.
