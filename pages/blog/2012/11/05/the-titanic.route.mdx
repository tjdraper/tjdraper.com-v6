Some wisdom, one day before the election…

Putting Obama in office for another term is like backing up the Titanic and hitting the iceberg again.

Putting Romney in office is like finding another iceberg and hitting that one instead.

_(This is not original but I have seen it around so much I have no idea who to attribute it to)_

We have no good options here people. So, I say, go to the polls tomorrow and vote for a third party because Romney and Obama are pretty much the same. No, the guy you vote for won’t get elected because we essentially have a two party system. But at least you will be able to say you didn't vote for either of the goons running now and at least you are giving your vote of no confidence in either "candidate" we have before us now.

And remember, no matter which really bad option we get, God ordained it. He is still on the throne.

Psalm 2:1-4:

**Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.**
