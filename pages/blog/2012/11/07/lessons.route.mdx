A couple of things:

### Be Conservative

If the only objective is to win, as seems to be the case with the GOP since they have abandoned all principles, then the strategy they chose was really, really bad. The democrats are better at getting out and promoting a liberal candidate. If the choice is between who is better at being a liberal, the democrats will win every single time.

Now, I’m not advocating the idea or strategy that the only objective is to win. I’m just saying that the strategy employed by the GOP was doomed from the very start.

### Learning

If I were into betting, I would be willing to bet truckloads of money that the GOP did not learn the lesson last night it desperately needs to learn, and that is this, simply put: be the conservative party. Give us candidates with backbone and principles.

But I would be willing to bet that the higher ups in the GOP think they just didn’t swing liberal enough and we gotta fish for a more slimy candidate next time. We have to get someone who will lie more than Romney and who will appeal to an even more liberal constituency.

My friends, this is because the Republican Party is not now, nor has it been for a long time, the conservative party. The game has become about winning, a game which the Republicans are playing very poorly. The sooner we realize that the Republican party has been lost, the sooner we can get to the business of doing what it takes to get this nation healthy again.

But the real problem is that no one realizes that the nation is deathly ill and needs help, not really. Some talk of Obama’s bad policies and like things, and even a few who voted for Romney realize that he wasn’t a great candidate, but only a very, very few realize that the core problem is much, much deeper. We need to clean house, and we need to start with the Republican party.

Actually, a complete overhaul of the political system wouldn’t much hurt my feelings.

### On The Throne

Barack Obama was meant to be our president for another four years. It was predetermined. It was foreordained. Whether as an act of judgement — giving us such a vile president for another term — or as an act of mercy — the possibility of eight years of a Romney presidency is far less likely now — is anyone’s guess. But the fact is that God is on the throne, he is in full control, and we as Christians are to be about the business of serving our great King and advancing his kingdom.

Nothing has really changed. Our dominion mandate is the same today as it was yesterday. Barack Obama is still the president as he was yesterday, and now will be for another four years. We need to be training our children, preaching the gospel, helping the poor, ministering the the sick and needy, and doing what God has called us to do.

To borrow from the charge in the liturgy of my congregation, which we hear each week, and which I think we need to hear now: **Go forth to love and serve our risen and reigning Lord Jesus Christ!**
