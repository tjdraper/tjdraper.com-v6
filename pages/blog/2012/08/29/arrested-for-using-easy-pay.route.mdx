> A New Jersey teenager was arrested this weekend for allegedly attempting to shoplift a pair of headphones from the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in Manhattan, reports Macworld. Eric Shine says he scanned the barcode of a pair of Bose headphones, and navigated the EasyPay purchase process to the final screen, but failed to complete his purchase. Upon trying to leave the store, he was stopped by store employees who accused him of shoplifting and called the police to have him arrested.

Two things.

1.  Honestly, this is why I was never comfortable with the whole EasyPay thing. It felt weird.
    
2.  What. On. Earth. Apple?!? You had the guy, he claimed to be trying to use your system. You had him. Make him pay and let him go. No harm, no foul. Not good customer service. NOT GOOD AT ALL!
