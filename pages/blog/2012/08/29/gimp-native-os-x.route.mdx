> Itâ€™s a great free PS alternative, but Mac users have long had to install X11 to get it to run. But not anymore! The newest version of Gimp for Mac OS X is bundled as a self-contained native app, that means no X11 installations, no Xcode, nothing but a simple dmg download.

Hey, guess what? It still sucks!

Could someone _please_ come out with a viable Photoshop competitor?
