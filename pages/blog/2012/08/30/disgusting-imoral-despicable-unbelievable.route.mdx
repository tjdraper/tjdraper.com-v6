> Later on as things were developing and the RNC was pushing through their power grab via the head RINO, Speaker of the House John Boehner and John Sununu, they didn’t even try to differentiate between the yes and no votes. Personally, I think either Boehner had one too many drinks or needed his ears cleaned or both. Because even on C-Span you could hear there was significant dissent.

> On top of that the RNC would not seat the Maine delegates and that brought about chants of “Seat them now!” However, at several tweets indicated that some convention people were to chant “USA!” in order to drown out dissent.

The events at the RNC this year show the most blatant and despicable corruption imaginable in a supposedly free society. My friends, the Republican Party has been lost and is now far, **far** worse than the Democrat party.

Oh, and this is despicable from my Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn:

> GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn just declared that “this has been a great exercise in grass-roots” and that GOP stands for “Great Opportunity Party.”

Seriously, **SERIOUSLY**?? When grassroots efforts in the GOP have just been shut down permanently? You. Must. Go. Woman!

And one final depressing though:

> Romney took the nomination with a total of 2061 votes. Should he be elected this year, he will also determine who the delegates are in 2016. That’s right, grassroots people will no longer have a say in the matter.

If you are as outraged as I am, you will write Ron Paul in on the ballot.
