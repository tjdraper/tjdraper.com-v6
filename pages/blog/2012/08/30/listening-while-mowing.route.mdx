> A tech savvy guy such as myself had not found a way around this wearying toil until a tech savvy friend of mine spoke up. He asked me the other day if I listened to anything while I mowed the grass to help pass the time. I was surpised to hear this suggestion coming from him because he should know better than to hurt his hearing by cranking up the volume on a pair of earbuds to hear the sound over the roar of the his mower…

> “That’s not what I do,” he said. “I wear noise-reducing earmuffs overtop of my earbuds so I can hear the music of podcasts at my preferred volume level; I don’t change the volume one bit because of the ear protection.”

Funny, that’s exactly what I do as well. I am often listening to podcasts while mowing so I don’t fall behind. I’ve also been known to listen to audiobooks or music as well while doing yard work.

My list of top podcasts differs from the Jackalope’s a little though. I know I’ve listed them here before, but I’m sure they’ve changed a little bit. And I like telling you, my readers, about stuff I like. So here are my favorites.

- [Amplified](http://5by5.tv/amplified)
- [Build and Analyze](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze)
- [The ExpressionEngine Podcast](http://ee-podcast.com)
- [Geek Friday](http://5by5.tv/geekfriday)
- [Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical)
- [Back To Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)

Additionally, you should subscribe to the podcast I do weekly with the Jackalope. It’s pretty good, I think.

- [The MovieByte Podcast](http://moviebyte.com/mbpodcast)

This is also a good time to mention a new show I’m still evaluating, but seems good so far. They just got started so I’ll give them a little plug.

- [A Good Mac Show](http://www.goodshows.co/a-good-mac-show.html)

And one more new show that I’ve just started listening to.

- [Screen Time](http://5by5.tv/screentime)
