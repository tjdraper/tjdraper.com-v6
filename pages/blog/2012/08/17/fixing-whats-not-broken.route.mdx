[Jim Dalrymple on The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/16/apple-boss-tries-to-gut-retail-operation/):

> One of the smartest decisions that Apple made over the last decade was to open retail stores worldwide, giving users a chance to get some hands on time with its products. One of the worst decisions came recently when the new vice president of retail John Browett decided to gut the operation. Luckily, he admitted his mistake.

And:

> This has the stench of a man looking to make a name for himself, not someone that’s doing what’s best for Apple or more importantly, its customers. To take one of the most heralded retail experiences in the world and gut it, stripping it of everything that makes an Apple store what it is, just doesn’t make sense.

Please read all of Dalrymple’s article. It is, as usual, great. What I want to talk about here is a little different. I want to talk about how we got here.

Ron Johnson was the genius behind the Apple Retail Stores. For reasons known only to himself, Ron [left Apple to become CEO of the ailing J. C. Penny](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/11/01/apple-retail-chief-ron-johnson-officially-departs/). Tim Cook [hired John Browett](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2012/01/apple-hires-john-browett-dixons-retail.html) to replace Ron Johnson. There were [questions](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/01/apple_ceo_tim_cook_allegedly_defends_new_svp_of_retail_amid_criticisms.html) about [this decision](http://9to5mac.com/2012/02/01/tim-cook-calls-new-retail-svp-john-browett-the-best-by-far/). But we “Apple Fanboys” as we are known tried to give Tim Cook the benefit of the doubt.

It looks to me from this vantage point like our concerns were well founded. What makes the Apple Retail experience great — best in class even — is the customer service. The decision to cut employ hours, as Jim Dalrymple put it, to “gut the operation” is endemic of what we find in most retail chains. There is a disconnect between pinching pennies, and the customer service a retail chain needs to be truly great. Saving pennies _right now_ often results in a very poor experience for customers, which results in a lack of customers, which results in the need to pinch pennies, which results… well, you get the idea. Apple’s strategy of success was being abandoned by Browett. It is good that the mistake was recognized and corrected. But I have a bigger question.

Why on earth was this man hired? I really hate to ask this next question because it will be taken completely the wrong way. I mean I _really_ hate to ask this question. But I’m going to. Would Steve Jobs have hired this man? And by that, I don’t mean, “What would Steve do?” I mean, would the principles Steve operated the company on have allowed for this man to be hired? Steve hired “A” players. Steve did not put up with “B” team players. It may seem cruel and mean — I certainly don’t think I could ever make the cut of an “A” team player at Apple — but that’s the way it is, and it’s how Steve was able to bring Apple back from the brink of the abyss.

I have to admit, I had my questions about Tim Cook’s ability to really lead Apple. I mostly kept them to myself because they seemed mean spirited on my part. And I didn’t and don’t want to be a member of the “Steve Jobs fanboy” club. Steve made a heap of mistakes and decisions I don’t think were the best thing for Apple. But there can be no doubt he was great for the company.

But now I ask the question, is Tim Cook right for the company? To me, the decision to hire a “B” player to run what is arguable Apple’s most important division is not a good sign. Tim was absolutely the right choice to be COO. He was able to increase Apple’s profit margins significantly, and was a major player in making the company healthy again. Of that there can be no doubt. But I really wonder if he has the vision and fortitude to lead the company.

I don’t want to be mean to Tim Cook. I want Tim to do well, I want Apple to do well. But I don’t want to see the company simply coast on Steve Jobs’ momentum until it runs out. I hope Tim sees what happened here and learns from it. I really hope this is just one of those decisions that we all make once in a while that leave even ourselves scratching our heads.

Time will tell.
