> But the rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to prevent carriers from blocking access to applications and websites over mobile connections are crystal clear: Mobile broadband providers cannot “block applications that compete with the provider’s voice or video telephony services.”

I have [said it before](/linkedlist/2010/08/theres-no-way-this-would-end-well), and again I just want to state, for the record yet again, I am not in favor of a regulated net neutrality. The very idea is oxymoronic. But having said that, let me address the issues here.

> Amid a wave of backlash about its plans to block FaceTime over mobile, AT&T Senior Vice President for Regulatory Affairs Bob Quinn took to the company’s policy blog on Wednesday to defend its plans to block the popular app on its network unless users pony up extra cash for its new, expensive “Mobile Share” plans.

Regardless of your position on the FCC’s involvement, which is a sticky issue because of how the industry is regulated and because the industry is controlled by a couple of very large cellular companies, this is a very anti-consumer move on AT&T’s part. I have yet to see anyone who is okay with this move.

At the heart of this issue is the idea that AT&T is already selling us metered data plans, and presumes to tell us how we can use this data, and in what contexts. I have no intention of switching to the [far more expensive mobile share plan](/article/2012/07/att-shared-data). So AT&T says I may not use the 2 GB for which I’m already paying for FaceTime. This issue alone means, unless AT&T corrects it, I will be switching carriers when my contract is up on principle. I would really like to go to Verizon, but [their share plans aren’t a lot better](/linkedlist/2012/06/share-everything), and are non-optional at this point. So I may consider going with [StraighTalk](http://www.straighttalk.com)’s ‘Bring Your Own Device’ plan which would be far less expensive (and ironic since they use AT&T’s network). It means I would not be getting a new iPhone, but honestly I am happier with the iPhone 4S than any previous phone I have ever owned.

I think AT&T had better start re-thinking their customer-hostility or they are going to start finding themselves bleeding subscribers. I could be wrong, but it feels like their hatred of customers is starting to become known to the masses.
