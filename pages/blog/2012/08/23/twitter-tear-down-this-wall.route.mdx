I originally intended to link a few articles on this subject as linked list items. Then I started writing mental drafts of an article on this subject. Then I collected somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 links on this subject, all of which I liked. I can’t link them all. And I find myself in the position of having too many things on my plate and not having time to really write about this even though I want to. I’ve settled for this. I’m going to quote a few things and link to a few things in this entry and let that be good.

First of all, if you haven’t heard, Twitter is [releasing a new version of their API and changing the rules](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api). Though shrouded in politico speak, when reading this from a perspective with any knowledge of the Twitter third-party client eco-sytem, the tone is ominous. The fact of the matter here is Twitter really doesn’t like the third-party Twitter client eco-system anymore that seemed so foundational for so long (so long developers, and [thanks for all the fish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc6aufHz-i0)).

My take away from all this is that Twitter is tired of providing value to users and developers and wants to get value out of them.

[Marco Arment’s thoughts](http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes) on the subject are a great read. Here’s just one part.

> How, exactly, will Twitter “guide” developers who are required to “work with them directly”? What exactly are “areas of value for users and \[our\] businesses”?
> 
> Translation: “Once you get big enough for us to notice, we’re going to require you to adhere to more strict, unpublished rules to make sure you don’t compete with us or take too much value from our network.”

And:

> I sure as hell wouldn’t build a business on Twitter, and I don’t think I’ll even build any nontrivial features on it anymore.
> 
> And if I were in the Twitter-client business, I’d start working on another product.

[Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/):

> If Marco’s reading is correct, it further takes action against any site that doesn’t want to use the native Twitter embed when quoting a Tweet, which is pathetic.

So are we really saying that we can’t link to and quote a tweet without using their stupid embed tweet thing? I’d love to see them enforce that legally or something. Not that I would be willing push it all the way to court, I have better things to do. But that is so draconian, and I don’t think they would have a legal leg to stand on.

Ben Brooks continues:

> The changes Twitter just announced remind me very much that Twitter has some massive problems, both at a service, and corporate level.
> 
> 1.  Twitter has stopped caring about the users that made the service popular, and started only to care about the users that can draw in more users.
>     
> 2.  Twitter has sold out. They not only don’t care about the original users, but they don’t even seem to care much for the current users — there’s a very real sense that Twitter needs to make money, and they need to make that money yesterday.
>     
> 3.  The people that really cared have moved on — either to new companies (Square and Medium) or simply moved on to something else.
>     
> 
> We like to make analogies to Apple in tech blogging circles, so here goes: this is the moment in Twitter’s life where they kicked Steve Jobs out of the company and told Sculley to run it.

Exactly. It’s like I told a friend of mine last night, the problem is Twitter is seriously angering its geek and nerd user base. Like it or not, us geeks and nerds often lead and drive the trends in the market. When we like something, we do what we can to evangelize it. Twitter gained its popularity because of geeks and nerds like us. Angering us instead of trying to find a way to accomplish their goals and keep their most vocal and loyal users happy seems like a really bad idea. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps Twitter has enough momentum now with the common folk that they’ll be okay without us, but I don’t think the business of ticking a segment of your users off and engendering ill-will toward your company is a long-term sustainable business model. Twitter, if it carries on with its user-hostile actions will eventually become the uncool thing that the common folk use, and eventually will die because no one wants to be considered a techno dinosaur. Even the dinosaurs don’t want to be dinosaurs. And when they find out what makes them perceived that way, they want to stop.

One more point and then I’ll provide a list of reading (and listening) material on the subject. [Alex Arena had this to say](http://alexarena.com/on-twitter-clients/):

> Twitter is trying to get rid of 3rd party clients before their own have fully developed. I honestly believe the outrage following these changes would be far less intense if Twitter just built apps that were better than their 3rd party counterparts.

This is exactly right and exactly part of the problem. Twitter’s official clients all suck. Tweetie used to be the premier iOS Twitter client. Twitter bought it and gutted it and now it’s useless and full of utterly drivellous terms like ‘connect’ and ‘discover’ and so forth. It’s horrible to use, and doesn’t support things like Tweet Marker that make Twitter usable for me. And as Alex pointed out in the linked entry, it’s been over a year since Twitter has updated Twitter for Mac. Twitter’s own house is not in order and they are starting to give third-party clients the boot. I do think there is a reason for this. I think Twitter wants to start pushing users to its website. Looking at the raw numbers, I’m sure this makes sense to them. But as I said, I think us geeks and nerds drive the market on stuff like this and I think these moves are very bad for Twitter long term.

The pencil pushers are in charge now and it really is like the Jobs and Sculley analogy.

Here’s the list of the rest of the articles and posts I liked on the subject.
