> I know how it was done now. Confirmed with both the hacker and Apple. It wasn’t password related. They got in via Apple tech support and some clever social engineering that let them bypass security questions.

I’m sure everyone who reads this site is familiar with this story by now. It’s a sad tail. And it doesn’t actually look like there was anything he could have _really_ done to prevent it. But there is still something to be learned here. One word. Say it with me. BACKUP! The fact that he is so dependent on Apple recovering the contents of his remotely wiped hard drive is not good. If my hard drive were to die right now and become un-recoverable, I would only stand to loose a very few things that I have done today because Time Machine ran last night, as I have it set to do every night. And even then, most of the work I have been doing today is either in DropBox, or published through a CMS so I really wouldn’t lose much today at all.

But I cannot stress enough the importance of having a backup in today’s digital powered world.
