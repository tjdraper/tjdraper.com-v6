> This is not the first time The World Magazine comes up with an opinion which is an expression not of the Biblical Christianity but of our modern, politically correct, emasculated parody of Christianity which is all too concerned to not hurt someone’s feelings, especially the feelings of those who are in an open rebellion against God and His Law.

As I saw a friend of mine say on Facebook yesterday and am going to steal for use here: Hammer, meet nail head.

I read [this piece](http://online.worldmag.com/2012/07/31/chick-fil-a-appreciation-day-a-bold-mistake/) by Barnabas Piper that Bojidar is speaking of while in the line at Chick-Fil-A. I can’t say I was all that surprised. Not with Barnabas specifically because I don’t even know who he is. No I was not surprised that this response would be coming from somewhere in the Christian camp, and furthermore that he had a lot of agreement in the comments.

Bojidar is right on the money in this piece and I wish I could get every Christian to read it. And not only read it, but _comprehend_ it. This is important. And yes, he is absolutely correct when he speaks of issues that are more important and why can’t we rally around those as well. I get that, and Bojidar gets that. But this issue is very important too.

Please read Bojidar’s article. This is important.
