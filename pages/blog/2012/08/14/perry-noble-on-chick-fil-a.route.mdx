> Recently Dan Cathy (the current CEO) was asked about his stance on same sex marriage. He did not issue any inflammatory remarks. He did not attempt to call anyone by any derogatory names. He was not hateful in his comments. He did not say that people who are gay would not be hired and/or served at Chick-Fil-A restaurants. He simply stated that he holds to the traditional/biblical view of marriage (which is his right as an American citizen.) And it seemed the world lost its mind.

I know this kerfuffle has died down and I’m late to this party, but I’ve been busy and I’m just now getting around to this. So deal with it.

I don’t agree with everything he says here but my quibbles are minor. I also don’t know much in general about Perry Noble, but the piece is worth a read.
