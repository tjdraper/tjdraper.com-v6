[Read the details of Matt’s hack attack here →](http://www.emptyage.com/post/28679875595/yes-i-was-hacked-hard)

I haven’t had anything to say about this yet. In fact I know I haven’t had much to say about anything lately. I’ve been really busy working on editing projects, launching the MovieByte website and all sorts of jazz like that.

But I do want to say some things about the Matt Honan hack.

First of all, it’s scary. Really scary. I think all of us who’s lives are very much lived in the digital world fear stuff like this. The fact that it is not really likely to happen to very many of us because most of us are not on anyone’s radar as targets is no matter. It still scares us.

You know what is even worse. It wasn’t really Matt’s fault. Sure, perhaps he shouldn’t have had all his accounts so closely related, but seriously, who would have thought that having his me.com email as a password reset for gmail, or keeping his credit card stored in what he thought was a secure amazon account (can you even choose not to have your card on file at Amazon if you bought something there?) would cause problems. The fact of the matter is that 99% of the blame for this lies on two parties, Amazon, and Apple.

That the hackers were able to add a bogus credit card to his Amazon account with a phone call, with no verification, then call back and get a password reset because they knew the info of the bogus credit card is absurd.

Even more absurd is that Apple let the hackers reset Honan’s iCloud account password because they knew the last four digits of Honan’s legitimate credit card, which they were able to see because they gained entrance to the Amazon account.

Apple did wrong. Apple did _very_ wrong. I don’t care what arguments can be made in favor of easy password resets and ease of use for the customer. The fact is if you loose/forget your password, it’s your fault and you _should_ be inconvenienced for it. You should be made to prove who you are by much stricter means. And you should most certainly not be able to so easily regain entrance to your account without your password. This is _your_ problem, not Apple’s (or Amazon’s or whoever the account holder may be in any given case).

Increasingly, our passwords are the keys to our lives. And in this case, Amazon and Apple held two really big keys to a room where backdoors from other digital places were located. I know I will certainly be thinking about how to keep my digital life more secure.
