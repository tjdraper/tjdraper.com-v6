> Blaming the format itself for link-blog overload is like blaming Canon for the deluge of mediocre SLR photography over the last decade. The tools are now available to everyone, which is great. Most people won’t become world-class users of these tools, but the surplus of mediocre output doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for more people who can be truly great at it — it just means that most people’s link blogs aren’t worth following.

Exactly. As someone running a link blog here, what I’m hoping to do is add value. I’m not trying to replace anyone or re-write anyone’s content or anything like that. I’m aiming for my opinions and links to mean something to someone, somewhere. And certainly, I have been inspired by Daring Fireball, The Loop, Marco and more. But I don’t think its necessarily bad to be inspired by someone or something that they’ve done. And I do hope I’m finding my own voice.
