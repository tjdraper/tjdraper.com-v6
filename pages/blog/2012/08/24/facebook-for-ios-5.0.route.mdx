> Facebook has announced that it has finally rebuilt its iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch app for speed. Facebookâ€™s previous iOS apps displayed and loaded all content view customized embedded mobile sites, but this new update is completely reengineered using native tools. Facebook says that the new update runs twice as fast as previous versions of Facebook for iOS.

This is a huge update. Some things look different, in a good way. But mostly, everything is simply fast and responsive. Facebook for iOS went from being easily the worst app I use on my iPhone on a daily basis to being one of the best with this update. Highly recommended!
