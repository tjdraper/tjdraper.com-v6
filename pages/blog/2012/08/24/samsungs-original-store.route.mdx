> Samsung, who is currently locking horns with Apple over various infringements with regard to cell phone and tablet patents, has just opened another retail store. This store is just a block away from Apple’s own store in Sydney, Australia and what’s more if you walked in without noticing the missing Apple logo outside, you may think you had walked into an Apple Store.

I mean this is really just ridiculous. Just go look at the pictures and tell me they aren’t completely copying the look and feel of the Apple store. These people have no shame.

> …they even dress the sales staff in the traditional blue polo shirts worn by Apple Genius staff.

Hilarious! Just Hilarious!
