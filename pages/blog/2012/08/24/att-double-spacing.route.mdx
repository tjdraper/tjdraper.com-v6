Speaking of double spacing after sentences, take a look at AT&T’s entry. No seriously, click through and tell me that does not look terrible! Not only are they being stupid and anti-consumer, but they have double spaced at the end of every sentence. By comparison to the move being spelled out in linked entry, this is _really_ low on the list of crimes. Still, it’s telling. Particularly telling is you have to purposely make this happen in HTML. Normally HTML will ignore more than one space between characters. You have to purposefully insert space entities in the HTML to make this happen.

Terrible. Just terrible.
