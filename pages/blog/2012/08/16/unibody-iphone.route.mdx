> Long story short, instead of using the entire metal band for antennas like in the 4, the 4S only uses the top and bottom sections as antennas. Since the flat sides don’t contribute to transmitting signal and only help with the structure of the device, it makes sense to make them even more integral to the structure. This is what makes a unibody iPhone possible.

Interesting concept, and it actually looks to me like it could be real enough. Also presented in the linked article are four possibilities:

1.  A very elaborate hoax
2.  A decoy made by Apple
3.  An early model or sample
4.  An actual production sample of the next iPhone

I don’t think Apple is above the decoy, but they’ve never done that before that I can remember so I don’t think it likely. I think options 3 or 4 are good possibilities. Time will tell.
