> Encoding video files on a Mac has only had roundabout solutions up till Mountain Lion. If you haven’t heard the good news, there is an all-new solution for video file conversion right from your Mac’s Finder or Desktop in Mountain Lion.

As a Mac Geek, I’m appropriately ashamed of myself for not knowing about this until now. The bonus tip is this also appears to work with Audio Files. The options for either don’t appear quite powerful enough for me, but it’s still great to know about.
