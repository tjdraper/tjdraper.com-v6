> Remember when Cook unveiled Browett as his first senior hire after taking the CEO job? Back in January, [I wrote about the appointment and noted Browett’s experience at pile-em-high, sell-em-cheap retailers](http://gigaom.com/2012/01/31/who-is-apples-new-retail-boss-and-what-will-he-do/) — a philosophy very much at odds with Apple’s.

I’m not the only one with questions about how Tim Cook could make such a stupid decision.
