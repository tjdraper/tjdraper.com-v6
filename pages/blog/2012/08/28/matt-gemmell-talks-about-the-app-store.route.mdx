> I recently released a new little Mac app, Sticky Notifications. Itâ€™s not currently in the App Store, and accordingly I went through a process that many Mac developers face: deciding whether to release software on the App Store, or outside of it (or indeed both).

Some of the details in the second half of the article get pretty boring, but the first half is well worth the read. I think it highlights well the places where Apple is _really_ messing up the App Store experience for both developers and users.
