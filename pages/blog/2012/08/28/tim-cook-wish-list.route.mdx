> Ars contributor Chris Lee thinks a limited license for OS X on OEM would help to keep things in check while allowing professional users more freedom.

Don’t count on it. The last time Apple licensed their OS it nearly destroyed them. While I don’t think it would have to go that way this time, I don’t see licensing coming. Actually, what I wish is that Apple would revitalize their pro-desktop line. That would eliminate the need for licensing OS X for pro users to have more powerful computers.

> I’d like to see less secrecy for the Mac Pro and OS X plans from now on. The smartest thing that Tim Cook did recently, from my standpoint, was break his vow of secrecy to say that there was a new Mac Pro coming in 2013.

It was smart, because there was a fervor and ill will building about the issue. But it was also odd and I don’t think it will happen too often. Still, I do also wish Apple would be more transparent sometimes.

> When I asked the Ars staff for their Tim Cook wish lists, this was by far the most commonly requested item. “Power” and professional users just feel ignored by Apple, and they’d really like to see that change in the coming year.

Definitely tops my wish list as well.
