The jury in the Apple/Samsung trial ruled largely in favor of Apple, finding Samsung to be in violation of a number of Apple patents and the like. Apple and Samsung have both [issued statements on the issue](http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/24/apple-and-samsung-issue-official-statements-on-todays-rulings/) which you can go read.

While I am glad on the one hand to see the ruling — Samsung is a shameless copycat and they have no originality of any kind to offer — at the same time I have very mixed feelings about it. This ruling is based on patent and copyright laws I feel are more harmful than good and that stiffle free market competition and innovation. Apple actually has a bunch of ridiculous patents. For instance, they have patented the idea of using apps on your smartphone during a calle. [No, really](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-57345445/apple-patents-using-apps-during-calls/). I don’t think anyone in their right mind (so probably not many come to think of it) would argue that Apple should be able to patent this. And yet…

Look, everone knows that I’m very much an Apple nerd/geek/supporter. But I’m not happy with some of the things Apple is able to do with our broken patent system. I mean seriously, how far are we willing to go here? Apple makes a phone with flat surfaces and rounded corners. Are we willing to say no one else can do that? Apple makes a phone with one button. Are we willing to say no one else may do that? Apple makes a cellular phone with a unix based operating system. Are we willing to say no one else may do that?

When you really start breaking down patents and patent law, it becomes very silly very quickly.

So on the one hand, I’m glad for Apple. They are working within the current laws and you can’t really fault a company for that. But I’m calling into question the existance of these laws in the first place.

For far better and well reasoned arguements than I can offer here, I _highly_ recomend John Siracusa’s take in his weekly podcast [Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical), in episodes 67 and 68:
