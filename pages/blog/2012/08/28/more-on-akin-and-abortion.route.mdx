Look okay, here’s the thing. Why on earth would he or anyone need to bring up the “legitimate rape” thing in the context of abortion? Pro-life should mean pro-life. It doesn’t matter how conception took place, it doesn’t matter if it’s a teenager sleeping around, or a woman walking a seedy street in Chicago wearing next to nothing just begging for, and getting it. It does not matter whether it’s my daughter or yours. Being pro-life should mean that you are never, ever for abortion. The reason is because abortion is the taking of a life. Abortion is murder. Murdering a child is never justifiable as a fix for a man and/or woman’s sin.

This is why the whole “legitimate rape” thing is completely silly to bring up. Whether you believe there are cases where rape occurred because a woman didn’t take appropriate precautions (Biblical concept, by the way), or whether you think scientifically that somehow rape victims are not in much danger of getting pregnant (they do get pregnant so it’s a moot point) the fact is if you are pro-life none of this matters. And this is the problem with Akin. He was trying to weasel out of his position, or somehow take the edge off of it. That’s not the kind of pro-life candidate I would be interested in.
