> It appears that the ‘Setting Time Zone’ function in iOS 5 can lead to excess power drain because the device is repeatedly polling the user’s location in order to set the time zone based on their current location (which is useful when traveling). To disable this functionality, launch the Settings app, navigate to Location Services > System Services and turn off the ‘Setting Time Zone’ option. You should see a purple location services icon in the iPhone’s status bar disappear:

This is a good tip/work around for now. It took me a couple days to figure out what was causing my battery drain.

I had this problem on my 4S after I first bought it. I really knew I had a problem when, on Sunday, I put the phone in the side pocket of my laptop bag during morning worship as I am wont to do. I did this at about 10:20 AM with 95% charge. At 12:30 PM when I retrieved my phone it was down to about 78%. This phone was also a little warm. This is **very** unusual for any iPhone I’ve ever had. Standby time has always been great. I noticed that the location services icon was on, and even after some time went by did not turn off. I went hunting in the location settings for a purple icon (which indicates a service currently using locations services). I found it next to the “Setting Time Zone” toggle. I switched it to “Off” and standby time has gone back to normal.

Apple has now acknowledged this problem and released a beta to developers that fixes this bug, but until the official release of the fix, this is the way to restore sanity to battery life.
