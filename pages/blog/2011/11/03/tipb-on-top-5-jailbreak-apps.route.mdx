> SBSettings has not only been around forever, it has remained one of the most useful jailbreak utilities available. It allows you to add quick toggles for commonly used features such as brightness, 3G, airplane mode, bluetooth, and more. While SBSettings comes with a lot of the more commonly used toggles built in you can download even more from Cydia. You can also download themes to change the look of SBSettings as well.

I must admit, SBSettings was always my favorite jailbreak utility, and seeing as an interactive part of Notification Center really looks awesome. This makes it tempting to go back to a jailbreak.

Alas, it is my intention to never jailbreak again. I hope Apple implements something like this. It’s always painfully difficult to get to the screen brightness, or any of the other toggles I like to get to quickly.
