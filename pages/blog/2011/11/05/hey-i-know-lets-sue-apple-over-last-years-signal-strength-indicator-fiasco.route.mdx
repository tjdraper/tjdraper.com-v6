> During the same week that Apple’s “batterygate” issues flared, last summer’s “antennagate” crisis has stepped back into the spotlight. A lawsuit filed in San Jose, Calif., on Thursday claims that Apple misled iPhone customers by displaying a stronger carrier signal than was actually available.

Right, okay, where do I start?

Let’s start here: cellular signal strength is measured in [dBm](http://goo.gl/P95gB), not those bars you see on your phone’s display. Those bars, in fact, are completely arbitrary. For instance a phone manufacture will say, well let’s see, -50dBm to -70dBm is average signal when the phone is near a tower, call quality is great at those signal strengths so we will display 5 bars at that dBM range (or 4 bars, or 6 bars or whatever).” And from there they develop a scale where the bars start to drop based on the correlation to dBm. The algorithms get a lot more complicated than that, but that’s basically it. It’s complete arbitrary. To be sure, carriers (such as AT&T) have recommended bar signal indicator to actual dBm, but it’s still all arbitrary.

Now, originally, Apple’s 3G signal strength indications were fairly skewed to show strong signal until the dBm got pretty weak, but again, who sets the standard on these things? And with most digital 3G technologies, signal strength doesn’t make any difference to data speed or call quality until signal is weaker than -110 dBm so I’m sure the thinking at Apple was to display good signal strength until the signal was weak enough to start degrading the user experience. That thinking was/is fundamentally flawed, [1](#sigstrength-fn1) but I don’t see how anyone could sue over this. It’s software, it’s an algorithm. Get over it people!

> The lawsuit does not seek restitution for call quality or reception troubles, presumably because AT&T bears most of the responsibility for that. Rather, it seeks recompense for the effect the faulty signal calculation method ostensibly has on the iPhone’s resale value. “The value of an iPhone with a fatally flawed Signal Strength Meter is less than the value of the same iPhone without the flaw,” the complaint states.

Precisely. Apple did conform their (arbitrary) algorithm to AT&T’s (arbitrary) algorithm. Admittedly, it was silly of Apple to use such a skewed algorithm, but this is not a “fatal flaw.” A simple software update to all 3G capable iPhones “fixed” this so called “fatal flaw.”

For more reading, Jacqui Cheng has a decent [write up of the bars and cell signal situation at Ars Technica](http://goo.gl/igLKn).

1.  It doesn’t matter whether cellular performance is not degraded at -90dBm, what matters is that the signal strength indicator, in Apple’s old algorithm, would not show signal was dangerously low. One could therefore assume it was okay to walk into an elevator, or some other place where signal might be more obstructed, and not know that it was a problem until the call dropped because when they took the call, they had what looked like full, or near full signal strength. This is one reason why a less skewed scale for the signal bars is important. [↩](#sigstrength-fn1-ref)
