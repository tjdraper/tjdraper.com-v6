> U.S. Cellular turned down Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone because it did not make sense for the company economically, CEO Mary Dillon said on the company’s third-quarter earnings conference call.
> 
> Dillon said that the carrier had the opportunity to sell the iPhone but that Apple’s “terms were unacceptable from a risk and profitability standpoint.” Dillon added that the potential strain on the company’s network was not a factor in the decision, and that U.S. Cellular remains open to carrying the iPhone in the future.

This seems like suicide to me. If you have a chance to pick up the iPhone, as a struggling smaller carrier bleeding subscribers, why would you not do it? C-Spire is a small little carrier, and [they’re going to start selling the iPhone](http://goo.gl/mhc7M). It seems to me that the boost they would get would outweigh the “unacceptable from a risk and profitability standpoint” bit. But if they think they can manage without the world’s most popular smartphone, more power to them. I am unconvinced:

> The company said 40 percent of the devices it sold in the quarter–356,000 units–were smartphones, up from 23.6 percent in the year-ago period, or 216,000 units. U.S. Cellular added that 26 percent of its postpaid subscriber base now has a smartphone, up from 12.1 percent in the year-ago quarter.

Anyone with the slightest bit of commonsense can see the trend. Smartphones are quickly becoming the norm. And not just smartphones, but specifically, iPhones, and Android devices. We can argue numbers over whether iPhone, or all the Android devices combined are more popular, but I think we can all agree that those two combined represent the lion’s share of the smartphone pie. Not selling one of the most popular smartphones on your network when you have the opportunity seems really really dumb.
