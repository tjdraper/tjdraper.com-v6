> While the sheer number of available Android devices has resulted in the platform surpassing Apple’s iOS in popularity, Apple’s limited portfolio of devices remained popular even as customers looked forward to updated hardware that arrived last month in the form of the iPhone 4S. According to NPD, **the iPhone 4 and 3GS continued to hold the top two positions in U.S. smartphone sales during the third quarter**, leading a series of Android phones in the rankings.

This is what Android people I talk to don’t get. This is where it gets interesting. The Android people in my life love to point out how much market share Android devices have. But as I have said before, Android is an operating system available on many different hardware platforms, while iPhone is one device (or 3 if you want to categorize them by the 3 models currently being sold). No single hardware manufacturer of smartphones outsell Apple’s iPhone, and these top devices are models that are 1 year old (iPhone 4) and 2 years old (iPhone 3GS). The fact that a 2 year old iPhone model is still the 2nd best selling smartphone in the U.S., being ousted from the top spot only by it’s successor, is very telling to me.

I know if I were given the choice between an iPhone 3GS or an HTC EVO 4G (or Motorola Droid 3, or an Samsung Intensity II, Droid Bionic, ad infinitum), I’d pick the iPhone 3GS hands down. And it appears many consumers feel the same way.
