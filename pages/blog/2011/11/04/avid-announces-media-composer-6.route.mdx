> With one eye firmly on the existing Final Cut Pro 7 user base, Avid today [announced Media Composer 6](http://www.avid.com/) using the phrase “Committed to the Professional.”
> 
> When Avid CEO Kirke Arnold opened the press conference this morning, her opening remarks included the phrase: “Not only is Avid committed to its customers, we are committed to the professional.” She also mentioned that recent sales of Media Composer have exceeded Avid’s expectations.

As always, I like to keep my eye on the competition, and both Adobe, and now Avid are targeting many users’ general dissatisfaction with Final Cut Pro X. I’ve not used Avid yet, and looking at some online video, tutorials and the like, it looks like it’s harder to use than necessary in today’s modern computer age. That said, this version does look better from the screen shots.

I can tell you this, competition is always good for the market.
