There was recently a complaint that I did not give any props to Android in my previous post about Over the Air updates. Android has had the feature for years, and I am therefore somehow obligated to point out how inferior Apple is for only now enabling the feature [1](#applebias-fn1).

Yes, Android has had that feature for a while, and yes, perhaps Apple should have implemented it sooner. But the fact of the matter is that the reason Apple didn’t implement it sooner is precisely the reason for Apple’s success. Apple has been focused on building the best mobile platform possible and giving user the best and most stable experience. Over the Air updates weren’t as high on the priority list as some of us geeks may like. This sort of thing is what I like to call “Feature Checklisting.” People get so caught up in the feature checklist they fail to realize there are more important things (such as usability and user experience).

But back to the point, even before now I have certainly been accused of having strong bias in favor of Apple. I’ve had people tell me they will no longer read Apple User Pro because of the strongly biased opinions I have. That’s fine. I freely admit my bias. It is likely that when you read something on this site it is going to be pro-Apple. I do not claim to be an unbiased news or reporting source. This site is where I provide my opinion and commentary, which is largely pro-Apple (perhaps you noticed the name of the site…).

So, while yes, I am trying to build up this website and get more readers, and I am trying in general to make something of this site, if you come here looking for unbiased opinions and raw news source with “no commentary” [2](#applebias-fn2), you have come to the wrong place. What you are getting when you come here is my opinions and things I find interesting [3](#applebias-fn3).

I hope that helps. I don’t want to loose any readers, but I did want to clear the air as to what to expect here.

1.  I did mention in said post that it was “about time” Apple implemented this feature, but that’s not good enough I suppose. [↩](#applebias-fn1-ref)
2.  Unbiased reporting with no commentarry or injected opinion is something I would argue is impossible anyway. [↩](#applebias-fn2-ref)
3.  This is not to say that I never report news. It’s just that I will most likely inject my opinion into that news. [↩](#applebias-fn3-ref)
