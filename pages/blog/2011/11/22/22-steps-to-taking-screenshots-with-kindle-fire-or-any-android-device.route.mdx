This is pretty unbelievable actually. It involves downloading the SDK, running unix terminal commands, adding devices via terminal command, more terminal commands. Wow.

I take screenshots on my iPhone a lot for different various purposes. It’s one step. Two if you count importing it from your camera roll if your purposes require you to have it on your computer. Though I don’t even do that anymore thanks to iCloud. Now, I take the screenshot, and by the time I get iPhoto open, iCloud has it ready for me in iPhoto.
