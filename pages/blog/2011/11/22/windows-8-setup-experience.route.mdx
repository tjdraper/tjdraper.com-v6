> Setup is something that gets a lot of attention from us in any Windows release.

Hahahahahahahaha…

Joking, right?

Up until Windows 7, setup was such a pain that even though I’ve done it more times than I can count, I always dreaded it. If Windows XP’s setup, for instance, is the result of a lot of attention than I’d hate to think what it would be like if they just slapped a little installer together and forgot about it.

> The scenario we presented at the beginning that included four different wizards and up to 60 screens in a Windows 7 upgrade can now be accomplished in one end-to-end experience and as few as 11 clicks, an improvement of 82% fewer clicks in Windows 8.

Guess how many clicks it took me to install Lion on my brand new SSD drive that I just purchased last week? (hint: it wasn’t 11, not even close).

Guess how many clicks it took me to upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion when I first purchased Lion? (hint: it was even fewer than installing on a blank hard drive).

Also, the clean install on my SSD took 8 minutes. Of course that’s an SSD so it’s going to be fairly fast so for comparison, the original upgrade install of Lion on my standard 7200 RPM internal hard disk took 23 minutes.

Still, being a former Windows user, and a fairly geeky person who cares to some extent about the inner workings of systems, I found it fun to skim this article.
