You might notice (if you click through and read this on the site and not via RSS feed) that Apple User Pro is designed pretty simply, and most importantly with dark text on a white background. That’s because the readability of my site is king. Everyone these days seems to go for the flashy and gaudy. But the longer I design, the more I admire simplicity and minimalism.

And it may be slightly off the topic of the linked article, but it’s related. So if you’ll indulge me for a moment… this same concept is also so it’s why I love Apple hardware and (usually) software. Take a look at OS X. For years now OS X’s design tendency has become more minimal. To get the interface “out of the way” so to speak. The iPhone hardware is another great example of the beauty of minimal design. As are all of Apple hardware products actually.
