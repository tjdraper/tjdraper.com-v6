> The chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, Julius Genachowski, released a draft order on Tuesday asking the other four commissioners to call an administrative hearing, saying that he found AT&T’s proposed $39 billion deal to acquire rival T-Mobile contrary to the public interest, reports CNET.

So I suppose T-Mobile going out of business is in the public interest? What’s T-Mobile to do?

Insane. This is not the free market at work, this is the government making more decisions on what is or isn’t, in their estimation, good for consumers.
