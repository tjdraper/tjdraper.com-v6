> “If you buy these phones thinking that you can use them, any of the thousands of Android apps, and the LTE data network for a host of really cool things like making VOIP calls, using Skype, streaming audio or video, remotely accessing a home PC, accessing cloud services, or any of the thousands of things that such apps enable, think again,” he said. “In effect, you are buying a fully enabled phone, crippled by AT&T’s Terms of Use.”

…

> AT&T’s restrictive list of unwelcome behaviors offers considerable detail. “Examples of prohibited uses include, without limitation, the following: (i) server devices or host computer applications, including, but not limited to, Web camera posts or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, automated machine-to-machine connections or peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing; (ii) as a substitute or backup for private lines, wirelines or full-time or dedicated data connections,” it reads.

> AT&T’s lawyers are grabbing as much legal ground as they can to support any possible usage challenge, Rasch said, “to make it easy for them to enforce their rights at some later date.”

> “Show me where in contract it says I can use Slingbox, unless you consider Slingbox to be Internet browsing, which is absurd,” Rasch said. “And is FTP use Internet browsing? The problem is they can decide at any time that doing these things is a violation of their terms of service and terminate you, and you would have no legal recourse.”

Technically speaking, almost everything you do on a smartphone is against AT&T’s terms of service if interpreted strictly. For instance, is using the Facebook app “browsing the web” Maybe, maybe not. Is using my IM client browsing the web? What about Pandora? What about uploading photos to my server for posting on the go with my FTP app?

They like it this way. They can do anything they want, they can claim violation of contract on most smart phone owners…

I have no doubt that AT&T will say nothing to me. In the grand scheme of things, I’m not one of their heavy users. But They have certainly cut themselves a wide legal path.
