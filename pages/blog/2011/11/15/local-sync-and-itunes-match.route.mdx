> When you enable iTunes Match on an iOS device (Settings -> Music -> iTunes Match), you’ll see a warning that “iTunes Match will replace the music library on this device.” When iTunes Match was still in beta, that message was true to its word: Any music you had on your device was indeed deleted, in favor of the library you’d uploaded to the cloud via iTunes Match. But in the official version of iTunes Match released Monday, that’s no longer the case. In truth, any music that was on your iOS device before you enabled iTunes Match will still be there—and that fact can save you on time and bandwidth.

Great info on how to get around “the cloud only” model when you have massive amounts of songs you want to sync (like say you just bought 10 new albums, or you’ve just restored your iPhone).
