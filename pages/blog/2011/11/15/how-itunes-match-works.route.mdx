> After a bit of delay, Apple launched iTunes Match today. The new $25/year service offers users the ability to match their existing iTunes library with high quality versions in Apple’s iCloud. The new service, however, has generated a bit of confusion about what exactly happens to your music library after you have enabled it.

Great info on how iTunes match works. I don’t intend to use it, at least not for a while, but it’s nice to know how it works.
