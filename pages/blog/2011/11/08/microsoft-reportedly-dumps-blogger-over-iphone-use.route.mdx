> Microsoft allegedly aborted a deal with a Swedish mobile blogger because he uses an iPhone.
>
> Toni Johansson, at the helm of site winMobile.se, said that responding to an email with the “sent from my iPhone” signature cost him a funding deal from Microsoft. As a result, he’s closing the site.
>
> “They abruptly closed the door due to the fact of a simple signature,” Johansson told iTnews via email.
>
> Johansson says he was very close to working out a deal with Microsoft to sponsor a redesign of his site. While arranging lunch with a Microsoft “evangelist,” Johansson answered and email from his iPhone.
>
> Instead of confirming the appointment, the Microsoft contact reportedly highlighted the iPhone signature on the email and shot back: “not a chance that we’ll continue after this!”

What an unbelievably arrogant thing for Microsoft to do. The guy runs a website about Windows Mobile, is he not allowed to test other phones to compare to Windows mobile?
