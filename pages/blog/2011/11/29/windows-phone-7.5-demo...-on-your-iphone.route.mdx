This link will only work on a compatible mobile browser. I’m not sure what all devices are compatible, but it worked with my iPhone.

It is an interesting look into Windows Mobile, and certainly a smart way to demo Windows Phone. In fact it’s a little awesome (hey, did Microsoft get their license to do something that awesome???).

I can tell you this, and I never thought I would say this about a Microsoft product… But if iPhone were to be taken out of the picture right now (oh, I don’t know why, use your imagination, say Cupertino got swallowed into the earth, along with every last bit of iPhone stock or something), the first [1](#winphonedemo-fn1) smartphone platform I would start looking at is Windows Phone. It’s not as good as iPhone, but it may well take second place in my estimation right now.

1.  My first choice would have been a WebOS device of some kind. Sadly, that doesn’t look viable any more.[↩](#winphonedemo-fn1-ref)
