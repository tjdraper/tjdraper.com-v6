I use ~MobileMe~ iCloud and therefore do not currently use Gmail for my email (though I used to). I’m not a big fan of web based email. Web based clients are essential for getting your email when you are not able to use one of your native device clients or something, but I rarely use MobileMe/iCloud’s web interface (though it’s quite good), and when I used Gmail I rarely used the web interface, preferring instead to use IMAP on my computer(s) and phone(s).

So having an interest in Gmail from past use (and who knows, maybe future use), and having an interest in native apps, specifically iOS native apps, I downloaded this bad boy and fired it up. I, [along](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/11/02/google-releases-official-ios-gmail-app/) [with](http://mashable.com/2011/11/02/google-pulls-gmail-app-for-iphone-ipad-sorry-we-messed-up/) [many](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20129136-233/looks-like-google-borked-its-first-iphone-gmail-app/) [others](http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/02/new-gmail-app-for-iphone-is-unusable-shows-errors-on-launch/), saw the error pictured above. Not promising, but I dismissed the error and moved on.

It appears to me that this Gmail app is nothing more than a portal to the mobile web interface for Gmail with a few native app hooks. That seems very disappointing to me. What’s the point of doing a native app if you don’t give the user a native experience?

So

1.  Google messed up push notifications out of the gate, making it useless to tell when you’ve got new mail unless you open the app.
2.  The experience is not the native app experience, but a web app experience.

It’s strange for me to be writing this post that is not so favorable to Google because normally (except for Android) I like Google stuff. And I am not among the users that hate the changes to Reader, or hate Google plus.

So hopefully Google will pull their act together on the Gmail app shortly.
