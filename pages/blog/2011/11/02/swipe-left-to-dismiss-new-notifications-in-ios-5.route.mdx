> If you want to quickly get a notification off your screen in iOS 5, all you need to do is swipe left across the notification and it’ll be pushed off screen.

I was unaware of this. Somehow I didn’t try swiping left because it feels unnatural to me. I was definitely slightly frustrated when a notification would pop up at the top of the screen and mostly cover a control I wanted to use up there.

This being an undocumented (and hard to discover) feature, who knows if it’s part of some sort of bug that will go away, but I’m going to enjoy it for now.
