> The Mac Pro has long remained a professional tool in an otherwise consumer-focused line of Apple computers. With a significantly higher starting price tag than its iMac cousin, and a wide range of user upgradability options that most Apple products don’t have, it makes sense that a report Monday (via [AppleInsider](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/31/despite_new_cpu_options_apple_reportedly_questioning_future_of_mac_pro.html)) claimed the Mac Pro might soon be put out to pasture. But would Apple really close the door on its most muscular and expandable Mac model?

I think you’d have to be blind if you have not seen the handwriting on the wall for this one. I’ve been seeing a lot of iMacs in professional settings as well as home use settings lately. And I think Apple is pushing Thunderbolt for a reason:

> Apple may also be able to shore up the demand for added expandability using Thunderbolt technology, which is another point reportedly raised in discussion among Apple execs. Thunderbolt expansion devices will soon allow video capture cards and other devices that use PCI Express expansion connectors to be plugged in outside of the case to an iMac, MacBook or Mac mini. Thunderbolt also allows the direct connection of much faster RAID storage devices, and multiple displays, something the internal PCI Express slots in the Pro once provided exclusive access to.

I’ve already noted PCI expansion slot adapters on the market that connect to the Mac via Thunderbolt. This, in my estimation, is the key. I think many are misinterpreting the signs from Apple lately. I do not think that Apple is abandoning the pro market. Many have claimed this by pointing to Final Cut Pro X as a mid-level “prosumer” but not “professional” product. I’ll admit Final Cut X has a little ways to go yet, but there is much more to FCPX than semi professional features. So if Apple discontinues the Mac Pro, which I think is likely, I do not see it as abandoning the pro market. I believe Apple is moving things in place to serve both the pro market, and the consumer market with a more consolidated product line.

Look at iPhone. There is not a “pro” version and a “consumer version.” One iPhone which both professionals and consumers use alike.

Look at OS X. There is not “OS X Pro” and “OS X Home User” (leave those sorts of things to Microsoft). There is one version of OS X. Apple, I believe, is moving in that direction here.

A friend of mine just bough an iMac for professional use. It’s fast. Very fast.
