[Huckabee: Tea party may ‘need to get behind’ Romney](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1111/Hucakbee_Tea_Party_may_need_to_get_behind_Romney.html)

> Mitt Romney may not be their first choice, but Mitt Romney every day of the week and twice on Sunday is going to be a much more effective president for issues that they care about than Barack Obama.

Really? Let’s see…

Romney sided with Bush on the bailouts.’

Romney wants to replace “Obama Care” … with his own version of healthcare that would be just as bad.

Romney is in favor of lowering taxes for certain classes of people and raising taxes for other classes of people instead of reducing government and having a fair, flat tax code.

Romney Supported State-Funded Abortions in 2002 and was pro-choice until 2007 at which time he deemed it better for his political career to “change” his position.

Romney also supported “gay rights,” and as Massachusetts governor, he implemented same-sex marriage by executive fiat.

Romney signed into law the Massachusetts health care reform legislation, which provided near-universal health insurance access via subsidies and state-level mandates and was the first of its kind in the nation.

Most importantly for us as Christians, specifically kingdom minded Christians, Romney is a Mormon. Mormons deny the deity of Christ and that there is only one God. Mormonism teaches that Jesus death on the cross is not sufficient to cover sin. As a Mormon, Romney is the enemy of our Lord Jesus Christ.

I’m not saying that we can **never** vote for non-Christians, but this must indeed be taken into account when choosing a candidate to vote for. Given all these things, Romney is simply not an option for us to vote for.

Anyway, why can’t we instead just all get behind Ron Paul? Paul is a Christian, and is by far the best candidate a Christian can vote for.
