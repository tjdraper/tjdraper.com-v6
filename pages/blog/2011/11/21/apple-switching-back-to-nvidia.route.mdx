> SemiAccurate reports that Apple will be transitioning back to NVIDIA from AMD as its graphics chip supplier for the next-generation MacBook Pro models offering discrete graphics.

Well, that’s kind of a drag if true. I really don’t like NVIDIA. The only NVIDIA card I’ve had was junk (of course that was the 9600 series which is basically just a ticking time bomb, but still). I have used plenty of other NVIDIA cards besides that one, and they just aren’t that impressive. ~ATI~ AMD has always made, in my estimation, better graphics cards.

> The move comes after Apple just recently completed a multi-year effort to switch its entire Mac lineup from NVIDIA to AMD.

That’s just a silly thing to say. Apple is always switching between NVIDIA and AMD. Different Macs at different times have come with different graphics cards, but for the last many years, always from one of these main two players. I wouldn’t call it a “multi-year effort” to switch. I think it’s more accurate to say that Apple felt AMD was better with the latest round of updates to it’s computers, that’s all. I have no doubt that even if this is true, we will see AMD cards in Macs again. Apple usually downplays the internal components of it’s computers as much as it can anyway so I don’t think they care one way or the other whether they use NVIDIA or AMD. And only geeks like me will care.
