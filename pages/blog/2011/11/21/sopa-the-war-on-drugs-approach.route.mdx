> Who supports the Stop Online Piracy Act?

> Mostly copyright holders and their associations. Viacom. Time Warner. Disney. The Recording Industry Association of America. The Motion Picture Association of America.

That should tell you something. Who’s interests do you think they are serving?

> After reading the bill, I thought about a story I reported on several years ago. It isn’t a perfect analogy, but it is worth pondering. When the 210 Freeway opened, it was good for residents of Alta Loma, Calif., who could get to and from Los Angeles more quickly. But nearby bank branches had a problem. Suddenly it was easier to rob them and escape. A masked man could snatch a few thousand dollars, hop in his car, and be speeding away at 70 MPH in under a minute. It had taken half-an-hour to reach a freeway. The new infrastructure made it significantly easier to get away with stealing from the local banking industry! Yet no one thought that California’s Department of Transportation was obligated to help catch the thieves using its network of high-speed roads.

A worthy analogy. And…

> When it suits their ends, copyright holders argue that online theft is analogous to theft in the real world. All I mean to say in telling those stories is that in the real world, we often recognize that a law that would in fact reduce a specific type of crime is incompatible with an efficient, free society. Shoplifters frequenting brick-and-mortar stores might justify tougher penalties for those caught; it could never justify making taxicabs, streetcar operators, car rental companies, and ferry operators liable anytime someone uses their services to return home from a shoplifting outing.

Please read the entire article. I don’t agree with every little nuance, but it’s 99% my exact thoughts, put into words better than I can do it.

Also, here’s the video from the article. Watch it, but READ THE ARTICLE!
