> Hotfile alleges that Warner Brothers abused this tool by submitting thousands of takedown requests for files it didn’t own. Hotfile suggests these requests were generated by automated crawlers without adequate human supervision. For example, Warner Brothers owns the copyright for the 2009 movie The Box. Hotfile alleges that Warner Brothers scraped websites for hotfile.com links containing the phrase “the box,” which of course led to takedowns for dozens of files that were clearly not Warner Brothers content. For example, Warner Brothers sought the removal of an audiobook called “Cancer: Out Of The Box” and a BBC production of “The Box that Saved Britain.”

> Indeed, some of the removed files were clearly not infringing at all. Hotfile says that the most popular file removed by Warner Brothers was a free software title that had been uploaded to Hotfile by its publisher.

Out of control. OUT OF CONTROL!

> The recently-proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, which is backed by the major Hollywood studios, would give copyright holders new powers to cut off websites’ access to payment processors and advertising networks. It even includes a new DMCA-style notice-and-takedown scheme.

This must be stopped. I sure hope our “let’s make all the laws we can” congress will have the good sense to see how terrible this legislation is!
