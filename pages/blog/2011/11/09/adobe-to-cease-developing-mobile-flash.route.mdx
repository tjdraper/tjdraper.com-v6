> This certainly looks like a sign that Apple has won the battle over whether Flash belongs on mobile devices, as Adobe appears to be transitioning itself to an HTML5 future.

This is the wrong perspective. Apple has not “won.” Apple saw the future. As usual, they saw where the puck was going to be and skated to that position.

I have no doubt that Apple would have included flash in iOS if it was viable for mobile platforms. But the fact is Flash has never been a particularly efficient technology. It used to serve its purpose. It was decent for desktop experiences at one time. But trying to shoehorn it onto the mobile platform where battery life and system resources are at a premium was always a bad idea. And Adobe has consistently proven that they are incapable of adapting Flash to mobile platforms.

And the bottom line here is that Apple has not “won” because we aren’t transitioning from Flash (a proprietary web publishing platform owned by Adobe) to some Apple proprietary technology. Flash is being superseded by web technologies that are much better, and that are more open and standards driven. This is a win for everyone.
