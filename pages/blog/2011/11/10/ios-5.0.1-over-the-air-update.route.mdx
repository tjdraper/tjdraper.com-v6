Apple issued the first update to iOS 5 today, available as an “over the air” update (I assume it would also be available via iTunes, but who wants to do that anymore? I didn’t bother plugging in to iTunes to check). I’m given to understand that at some point my phone would have checked for the update automatically and let me know it was available, but I’m not the patient type so I went to Software Update as soon as I knew it was out and checked for the update.

It was pretty painless. In less than a minute after clicking “update” I was given this screen:

It took about 3 minutes to install after that. My only complaint was that my phone did not reboot itself, but shut down after the update was finished. I waited on the black screen for about a minute before decided to try the power button. It immediately booted and Software Update showed that the update had been installed.

This seemed to be a glitch that only affected my phone, because my wife’s 3GS did automatically reboot after the update when I updated it.

Over the air updates are definitely very nice (if long over due to iOS). No worrying about plugging the thing into iTunes, rummaging around trying to find a cable and all that jazz.
