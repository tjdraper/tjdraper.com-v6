> The House Judiciary Committee today held an important hearing on the Stop Online Piracy Act with a hugely stacked deck of witnesses—Google’s lawyer was the only one of the six to object to the bill in a meaningful way. And it wasn’t hard to see why. This wasn’t a hearing designed to elicit complex thoughts about complex issues of free speech, censorship, and online piracy; despite the objections of the ACLU, dozens of foreign civil rights groups, tech giants like Google and eBay, the Consumer Electronics Association, China scholar Rebecca MacKinnon, hundreds of law professors and lawyers, the hearing was designed to shove the legislation forward and to brand companies who object as siding with “the pirates.”

What could possibly go wrong indeed.

> O’Leary of the MPAA smirkingly took on his (largely absent) opponents by saying that SOPA critics were engaged in hypocritical hyperbole and were pro-piracy

This “hearing” isn’t about actually “hearing” anything, but about pushing this heinous bill forward. Believe me when I say that this is one of the worst bills to come through in a while. The ramifications of this if it gets through are simply to enormous to fully comprehend right now.
