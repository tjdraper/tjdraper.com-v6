What Apple is good at doing is not making entirely new technology that no one has ever heard of before, but rather taking existing technology or ideas and making it work in a way that makes sense. They make stuff work the way it should. No one would say that mp3 players didn’t exist before the iPod, they most certainly did. But they were clunky and hard to use. Not one of us argues that Apple invented the smart phone. Smartphones existed before iPhone…

…but what a mess.

In the same way, voice technology existed before Siri, I’ve used voice activated technology and transcription before Siri too, but it was hard to use, clunky, not well integrated. Even Siri, before Apple acquired the tech was harder to use and not well integrated.

So I don’t deny that Microsoft has had this technology in existing Windows phones, but I do argue that it’s not as good, well implemented, or integrated as Siri and that’s why we’ve never heard much about it before.
