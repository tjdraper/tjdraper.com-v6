I’ll admit it. I’m a top poster. I’m not one of those geeky “bottom post or you’re an ignorant imbecile” types. In fact, I rather hate bottom posting.

What on earth am I talking about? I’m talking about email of course.

[Wikipedia - Posting style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style)

I don’t remember exactly what triggered it, but I saw someone post somewhere about [John Gruber’s](http://daringfireball.net/) “preference” for bottom posting (I hear he’s rather religious about it actually). I googled it and only came up with [this](http://daringfireball.net/2007/07/non_top_posting_scripts) from Gruber:

> Mail’s Reply feature is hard-wired to encourage top-posting, an uncouth and illiterate practice.

That’s sort of harsh given that it’s an accepted standard to top post in email replies these days. To be sure, I’ve seen bottom posting and I understand the origins of it. But I’ve always sort of hated it when I get emails that have been bottom posted. I have to scroll to get to the relevant reply, and I already remember what I sent in the first place. I don’t need to read it again.

I did some more snooping around to see if anyone could capture well the reasons I prefer top posting. And I found this [Hawkwings article](http://www.hawkwings.net/2005/10/03/shooting-yourself-in-the-foot-or-head-one-round-in-the-bottom-vs-top-posting-war/) which I though captured my thinking well.

> Internet communication is more like a notice-board or the bits of paper on the front of your fridge. The most recent, currently-important stuff is on the top. Blogs understand this. They top-post. Some discussion boards and forums understand this. News sites understand this. They have a better metaphor; they all top-post.
> 
> In practice the situation is just as bad. Bottom-posting means scrolling down past inches of text that you already remember or don’t need to know, in order to read the poster’s contribution. The Mighty Mouse gets a good work-out, but it’s a bad result for efficiency or sensible communication. Imagine burrowing down to the bottom of the pile of notes on your fridge to find the newest. Who would put up with that?

> What’s more, it leads people to top post that there is a bottom post.

_click through and read it all, there’s more (but not a ton more so click on through)_

There are rare occasions when I need to line by line reply to some email or other I’ve received, in which case, I’ll insert my replies to each line as necessary. That’s not really bottom posting, that’s quoting and replying. For 99.9% of all email communication, I top post, as do all my colleagues. And it’s not like I don’t have all the other emails to go back to anyway. And I _can_ always scroll down to look at something if it’s just not convenient to look at the other emails. And now with threading coming to more and more email clients (I love threading), it really doesn’t matter as much. In fact, Mail 5 (by far and away the best email client currently in existence) hides quoted part of the email by default. It’s great. and I can scroll right down through the thread to find any relevant parts of the conversation I need refreshing on.

Bottom posting is a relic from a bygone era, and good riddance to it I say.

In my googling, I also found this random article that I agree with. I don’t know anything else about the guy, or the site, but I like this article.
