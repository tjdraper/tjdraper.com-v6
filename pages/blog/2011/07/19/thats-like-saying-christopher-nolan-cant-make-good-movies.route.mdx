Okay, that’s just weird. I may have serious issues with all this patent trolling and copyright garbage going on in our modern world. But saying Apple is suing over patent issues because they can’t innovate is just silly. Apple is one of the most innovative companies of our time. Not all of us may always like Apple’s innovation, but they’ve got it going on!
