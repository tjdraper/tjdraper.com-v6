I am starting a new category called _Software I Use_, and this will be the first post in said category.

For some time my household finances have been run by Quicken. Quicken 2004 to be exact. That was the current version when my wife and I got married, and we never saw a reason to upgrade. Now, fair disclaimer: my wife does the finances in our household. She has a much greater rapport with numbers than I do. While she will sometimes call me to look over her shoulder on things, and while I take the financial responsibility in our household, the bookkeeping is one job I am happy to delegate to my wife and one she is quite willing to do. So I cannot really do a thorough review of iBank (or Quicken for that matter), nevertheless I have a basic working knowlege to go on.

When we first got started with Quicken I remember even at that time (2005) being a little put off by Quicken’s kludgy and unintuitive interface. My wife assured me it had the functionality that she needed, but I was shocked at the lack of care and thoughtfulness that went in to developing the UI. However, as I say, it had the features we needed and so we commenced.

Apple announced their transition to Intel processors in 2006, and of course, they announced the need to create Universal Binarry applications that would run on both Intel processors and the old PowerPC processors. But, as they basically said, not to worry if you (as a developer) are in the middle of a development cycle, OS X-Intel will still run your PowerPC binaries, albeit a little bit more slowly. But it was clear, developers should be compiling Universal Binaries from here on out. Anyone with the slightest bit of intelligence could have told you that at some point, Apple would drop support for PowerPC binaries altogether.

But, 2007 rolled along and Intuit released Quicken 2007 for Mac. It was still PowerPC only, and did not have any new features that we could or would take advantage of. We had no compelling reason to upgrade.

At this point I sort of pushed Intuit and Quicken to the back of my mind thinking, they’ll get with the program eventually.

Fast forward to June 2011. Apple has announced that Lion will not support Rosetta (and therefore PowerPC binaries). And my brain clicks into gear, “oh yeah, we still have one major software application that requires Rosetta.” So I immediately headed over to the Intuit website and clicked on Products. I skipped over Quicken Essentials because I thought, I want to continue with the full version of Quicken and this “Essentials” business doesn’t sound like a full version to me. So I clicked on Quicken. And this was when I realized something was very wrong. The system requirements said nothing about Mac or OS X. Of course Windows was supported clear back to ‘98, but Mac was nowhere to be found. So I backtracked to the main page and found a link for Mac software. And there, all by it’s lonesome, was Quicken Essentials. No other application that Quicken makes was available for OS X. So with a slightly uneasy feeling of betrayal in my stomach I downloaded the trial version of Quicken Essentials. It is a Universal Binary application, so it would be supported in Lion. Well, I thought maybe this would be okay after all.

How sadly mistaken I was.

I immediately went about the business of trying (and I use the word “trying” deliberately) to import our financial data from our previous version of Quicken.

I’m not going to go through how painful that process was, I will simply summarize by saying that Quicken needs to fire whoever designed that UX and hire some new UX people. It was horrendously, nightmarishly painful!

And so, after all that pain my wife and I discovered that Quicken “Essentials” is nothing of the sort. The word “Essentials” simply has no place in the name of this application. Just as an example, on our home mortgage (set up in Quicken 2004), there was no way to edit certain recurring transactions and payments. Once set up, it was set in digital stone! And there was no view for seeing where we were at on our mortgage. In short, all the tools of Quicken 2004 we were used to had simply vanished in Quicken “Essentials.”

We gave up this new version of Quicken as a bad job and began a tedious search for a replacement. We soon discovered there is a dearth of decent financial software for the Mac. You know that old myth that you shouldn’t get Mac because no one writes software for it and you therefore can’t do anything useful with your Mac? I had until that very day found that to be entirely untrue. I have never, ever had trouble finding any software I wanted, ever. In fact I would say that the majority of the time, the software available for Mac is of a much better quality and does things in a much better and more intuitive way than Windows software. So this was a first for me. We looked at and tried all sorts of financial software for Mac. SeeFinance, Money Dance, and Koku, just to name a few. None of them had all the features we had come to rely on in Quicken 2004. I was about ready to give up and tell my wife she was just stuck with Snow Leopard and would not be able to upgrade to Lion.

Then we discovered iBank. The first good sign was that iBank effortlessly imported all our Quicken data (iBank imported our Quicken data better than Quicken Essentials did, go figure). This was promising. And then, I noted that the interface didn’t look like something out of the ‘90s. It looked modern and intuitive. In fact, in my testing of it to make sure I could use it in the event Rachel was unavailable, it is far easier to use and understand than Quicken 2004. All the accounts and mortgages are listed right there in the sidebar on the left, entering transactions is easy, and search… is awesome!

For a short period of time my wife maintained both Quicken and iBank, entering everything twice, just in case for some reason iBank didn’t work out and we needed to fall back on Quicken.

As we neared the end of the 30 day trial period for iBank, my wife informed me she had stopped entering things in Quicken and was solely using iBank. She said there are even things about iBank she likes better than Quicken (she, you see, was perfectly happy with Quicken and was not happy that Intuit had dropped us Mac users like a hot potato).

I made the purchase of iBank and we haven’t looked back.
