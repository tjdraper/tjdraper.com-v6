Iâ€™m not a regular reader of Harvard Business Review, but a friend of mine shared this article on Google Reader, and I found it to be a short and excellent read. And spot on. Though I have traditionally loved my Netflix service, I was both shocked and disappointed by this recent move. And the analysis about lack of response, using a spokesman etc. was, in my estimation, exactly right.
