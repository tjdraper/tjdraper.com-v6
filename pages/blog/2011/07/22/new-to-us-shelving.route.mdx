Due to our recent quest to find more space in our 900 square foot house, we have been working on ways to make more efficient use of space. One such way presented itself in the form of bookshelves that had been in my in-law’s basement. Rachel wanted to get rid of our space hogging Entertainment center and replace it with the slimmer and more space efficient shelves. Many shelves were unfinished however, and Rachel was intent upon having a corner shelf. She promptly volunteered me for the wood working. I went to Lowes and bought some supplies for the supplementing corner shelf, and set to work cutting, sanding and staining

(Rachel didn’t get many pictures of this process, and I was, well, working…)

Sanding:

After doing some initial work outside, we had to move the staining process to the kitchen because it kept raining little bits at a time. It was kind of a mess for a while.

Then we had to set it all up.

And the final product…
