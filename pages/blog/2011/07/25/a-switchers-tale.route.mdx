Love it! Also, this quote from the article is AWESOME!

> For those of you under the age of 25, a magazine is a blog made out of trees

Nice!

Some other highlights from the article:

> During the 1990s, the only time I saw a Mac was whenever I ventured into the design and production ghetto of our editorial offices. That’s right: Windows Magazine was designed and laid out on Macs.

…

> Many Windows users don’t switch to Mac because they have an outdated belief that application choice is too limited and that Macs are too expensive. That might have been true for a lot of people in the 1990s. But nowadays, people mostly use browsers, e-mail, office applications and a few other common applications that are widely available. And Macs aren’t that expensive. PCs look cheap when you go to the Dell web site and see the “Starting at….” Price. But once you add the amount of RAM you’ll need, a decent hard drive, upgrade the processor to something better and pick the bigger monitor, you’re probably going to pay at least as much as a comparable Mac.

…

> I’m a huge fan of MPG computing (for multi-touch, physics and gestures). I thought both Microsoft and Apple would then aggressively pursue MPG systems, Apple from the bottom up, and Microsoft from the top down. But only Apple did so. Microsoft slept.

…

> If Apple can turn the editor of Windows Magazine into a fanboy, no one is safe.

The article is an enjoyable read so go read it.
