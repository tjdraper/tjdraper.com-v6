So I’m just going to jot down some thoughts on using Lion for the first time in an actual work environment as I have them.

First of all, some background on my installation of Lion.

I almost always choose to reformat my hard drive to install new OSes. The one time I did an upgrade install I did wind up reformatting and re-installing later just because I could tell it wasn’t a completely clean system. However, I do think I’m a special case. I am what most would call a power user. I drag massive files onto my hard drive, I drag them off, I move stuff, I install stuff, I try stuff, I mess with stuff. Over time, the preference files get left lying around, system tweaks get incompatible with new OSes, permissions get messed up and Disk Permission repair doesn’t always seem to be able to fix it. As I say, I’m a special case and I think most users can and should do the standard upgrade install. But I chose to clone my disk to a Disk Image file, reformat my HD and clean install Lion (and yes, this is still completely doable, not going to go into how here, but it’s not hard at all).

So I started with a clean install, and brought my data over from my disk image backup… I’m working with a completely clean system here. And it is very nice. I’m not sure if an upgrade install would have been any different, but in most cases my computer does feel faster. And where it doesn’t seem faster seems to be related to bugs (as any new OS will have).

**Pages**

I’m typing this article in Pages (so much better a word processor than Word by the way), but I am one version behind so I did not expect there to be Full Screen support. I was surprised then to see the full screen button in the top right of the Pages window. I clicked it and sure enough, Pages jumped to it’s own space in full screen mode. But I was surprised to see that it has a different full screen layout than any other app in Full Screen I’ve used thus far. Here’s a screen shot of what this document looks like in Full Screen mode:

As you can see, there is no linen texture (as with every other Full Screen app so far), everything around it is black. What you can’t see in that screen shot is that I’m using dual monitors. My second monitor is to the right and is completely black. Now, in most applications I’ve used Full Screen on dual monitors, the app simply does not take advantage of the second screen at all (this is very bad). But in this case, I’ve opened up a bunch of floating pallet windows and have them all on the second screen. I actually like Pages in Full Screen mode very much.

(edit: it turns out I do have the current version, I just thought Apple released a version since the version I have…)

**Dual Screens**

But speaking of Dual Screens in Lion, for the most part, Full Screen apps are useless in a dual monitor environment. It’s not like I’ve lost any functionality from Snow Leopard, so I suspect I’ll just continue to use everything in Windowed mode on one Dual Monitor desktop (unless the app makes good use of the second screen in Full Screen mode like Pages does). But what I would really love to see Apple do with Full Screen and Dual Monitors is somehow let me have Full Screen apps side by side, one on each monitor. How this would be executed exactly I don’t know, but this is Apple, they can figure it out. Are you listening Apple? Go and do!

**Mission Control**

Mission Control feels exactly right. In previous iterations of OS X I tried to use Spaces but it just felt awkward. The whole grid layout was cumbersome for one thing. And then, being a moderate Exposé user, Spaces became even more cumbersome because Exposé would not show me anything in another space. Mission control feels much more natural and useful for handling all of this!

**Mail 5**

I love the new look and feel of Mail. In the past I’ve hacked it to have a vertical 3 panel view, but it was hacky (as indicated by the fact that I hacked it). Even more recently, I used Sparrow quite a bit, but found that sometimes it just didn’t have quite enough power to do some of the things I needed to do (like someone sends me an email to my personal account that’s work related and I need to move it to my work account for proper filing, can’t do it in Sparrow).

But the new Mail seems to be everything I liked about Sparrow, but with the power of Mail. Native vertical 3 panel view by default. Proper conversation threading with related messages view (meaning it will show my replies to conversation threads in line). It’s genius!

**Auto Correct**

I’ve seen people griping about the iOS like auto correct when typing… However, I’m loving it. There is visual feedback as it happens if you don’t like what it did you can fix it, and 99% of the time it just works.

**Finder Dragging Animations**

For the most part I’m happy with the new animations in Lion. Most new animations convey some information to the user in some way that was not communicated before. Or at the very least they are harmless (such as new windows opening from the center very small and enlarging to the place they wind up, it’s a cute animation and takes about .3 seconds).

But the new Finder Drag animation is extremely unwieldy and conveys no necessary information to the user. For instance, when dragging a folder or file from a Finder window to the desktop, as you move to the desktop, the items you are holding with the cursor seem to grow and move. My first response when this first happened was to let go of the mouse button, dropping the files wherever my cursor was. It was not pleasant and I wanted to find the developer that thought this was a good idea and choke him.

I have not warmed up to the animation at all since that first initial encounter. Icons should not move around, shift, or change size once the user has grabbed them. That they do so tells the user that something is happening without their input and, at least in my case, the impulse/initial reaction is to stop and figure out what is going wrong. It’s dumb, and I hope that they remove the animation in subsequent updates, though I doubt they will.

John Siracusa [said it best](”http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/15“):

> Cocoa in Lion gives developers more control over the image displayed when an item is dragged from one place to another. The Lion Finder uses this control to transform multi-item selections from the usual ghostly image of the source into a compressed, realigned, list-view representation. This transformation happens a moment or two after the drag begins. While this is a fine demonstration of a new API, the experience is a bit off-putting. **Imagine taking a dish out of the dishwasher and then having it start flopping around like a fish in your hand.** This is a rare case of Apple losing sight of what’s important in real-time interaction design. Stability and responsiveness lead to comfort. A transformative animation (instability) that happens after a short delay (the appearance of unresponsiveness) does not make for good experience. I wonder how many novice users will instinctively release the mouse button and inadvertently terminate the drag operation the first time this animation is triggered.

**iCal**

No, I’m not one of the haters of the new leather look. I don’t mind my applications having their own personality.

But…

I really miss the dedicated calendar sidebar. The popover just isn’t working well for me. I really like to be able to turn calendars on and off from the current view. Like I don’t need to have my daily scripture reading visible when I’m at work trying to figure out what’s on the calendar. The pop-over makes it a 3 click deal instead of one click (one click to open the pop-over, another click to turn off the calendar I don’t want to see right now, another click to make the pop-over go away). Please Apple, at least bring back the sidebar in such a way that we can turn it back on if we want it!

**Address Book**

I’m pretty sure that this new Address Book is a huge step backward. The old one was so much easier to use. I’ve tried to determine if I’m just rebelling because it looks different, but I don’t think so. Still, it’s not unusable, and maybe I’ll get over it.

**Gestures**

The gestures used on the trackpad feel so natural that I find myself going to my trackpad to use them rather than the Magic Mouse I have connected. Don’t get me wrong, when I’m doing serious design work or video editing, the Magic Mouse is essential for precession, but the trackpad gestures are well done. The limited number of Gestures for the Magic Mouse, though I do use them, are not quite as natural, and as I said, a bit more limited.

My favorite trackpad gestures are:

-   Four Finger Swipe Up - Mission Control
-   Three or Four Finger Pinch Open - Show Desktop
-   Four Finger Swipe Across - Switch Spaces
-   Three Finger Drag - place cursor over window and drag it around
-   Two Finger Scrolling - We’ve had this for a while, but it really is great!

**Additional Note on Mail**

I put the “Move” button in my Mail Toolbar. I’ve been using it A LOT today. I love it! It’s a drop down menu that lets you move the selected message or conversation to a folder.

Just for grins, here is a screen shot of my Mail 5 toolbar:

**Gray-ish sidebar icons**

Mail, Finder… any native sidebar has gone pretty much grayscale with the icons. It’s really growing on me. It seems much classier and I don’t have any trouble at all identifiying the different icons.

**The Look**

Now remember, I’m just writing down stuff as it comes to mind.

So, Lion’s new take on Aqua. I’m liking it so far. But first, a look back from my perspective. I remember when I first saw OS X (10.2, Jaguar, if you care), after having known only Windows, I thought OS X looked mighty slick. I mean there were candy looking things everywhere. The gumdrop looking traffic light buttons stood up off the title bars, inactive window title bars were semi-transparent, and pinstripes (yes those awful pinstripes…_shudder_), they were everywhere. And indeed, my frame of reference was the eyesore called Windows XP (remember though that the frame of reference for Windows users when XP came out was the Classic Windows look, Windows 2000, ME, 98 etc.). Windows XP was so overdone.

But now, looking back on OS X, Aqua was also WAYYYYY overdone. Way to garish. The OS got in the way, called too much attention to itself.

Jaguar was my first look into the Mac world and OS X, but my first Macintosh came with Panther. It was definitely toned down from Jaguar. The pinstripes were muted to be barely discernible, the transparencies were toned way down, buttons no longer looked like they were floating on top of their title bars and so on. In general the garish look was being refined, polished into something more elegant. Each release of OS X has had this more polished, more muted feel. Lion accelerates this, and I’m glad for it. I have long been feeling that Aqua was just a bit too garish, the most egregious exampling being the blue pill shaped scroll bars. And thankfully, they are gone! Scrollbars only appear when you are scrolling with a trackpad or magic mouse (muted looking scroll bars do permanently appear if your only input device has no means of scrolling built in, but that’s rare these days). Buttons are more squared off and not lozenge shaped, and they don’ look like they are standing off the item they are embedded in. Everything in genearl is more muted and it’s a welcome change.

**Window Management**

This is really just more of the Mission Control stuff, but it’s worth saying again, window management has taken a huge step forward in Lion. I’m very happy with it.

**Safari 5.1**

It’s very fast and has a bit more polished feel to it in general. It’s hard to define. But it is certainly fast.

**Login/Lock screen**

Sometimes it’s the little things that delight me. The much more polished and modern looking login in screen, and lock screen are nice!

**About this Mac/System Information**

This is one of those seemingly unimportant areas that received some attention in Lion. The new System Information app (that replaces System Profiler) is very nice looking and not nearly as intimidating as the old look. Though System Profiler gave a lot more information, System information gives the most basic information one might need, and does so in a way that looks nice and is easier to understand. However, if you really need to dig into the nitty gritty of Lion, the same old System Profiler looking view is available by clicking “More Information.”

**General stuff**

I would say Lion is probably the most stable .0 release of any OS X release I have ever used. Though it’s not without it’s bugs.

One bug that was pointed out to me (I don’t think I ever would have caught it myself since I rarely do this) is one that affects Safari. To trigger it:

1.  Put Safari in Full Screen Mode
2.  Open two tabs
3.  Drag one tab off to create a new full screen window from that tab
4.  From the menu bar choose “Window > Merge All Windows” and watch the ensuing chaos as Safari “seems” to think it’s still in full screen mode, but has actually moved to the nearest desktop.
5.  Now in an effort to restore sanity, choose “View > Exit Full Screen”
6.  Now watch Safari crash

Pretty fun to see this glaring bug having got through Apple’s testing. Like I said, I would NEVER have discovered this on my own, that’s just not the way I use Safari.

As far as third party apps go, I used Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Coda, Transmit, and VMWare Fusion all day today without any problems save the occasional 10 second or so beach ball with Photoshop (I don’t recall it happening quite as often in Snow Leopard), but nothing unusable.

That’s pretty much all the thoughts I had today. I may have more later.
