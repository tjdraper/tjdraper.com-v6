He’s not right about not being able to drag and drop an attachment while Mail is in Full Screen mode (grabbing your file from the finder, then getting back to Mail using Command + Tab while holding onto your file allows you to drag and drop just fine), but overall he’s positive about Mail 5. And I’m very much liking it too! Lion was worth it just for Mail 5, I’m telling you! It’s got everything I liked about Sparrow, and everything I liked about the previous version of Mail.
