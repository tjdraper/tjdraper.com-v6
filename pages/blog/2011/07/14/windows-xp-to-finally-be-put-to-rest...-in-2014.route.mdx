That really seems incredible… no wonder Microsoft can’t move forward.

You know, every once in a while I get annoyed with Apple for making something obsolete a little too soon. But that doesn’t happen often. And I know Apple needs to keep their operations fit and trim to keep moving forward at the appropriate pace.

And this really puts things in perspective and demonstrates a problem at Microsoft.

Of course, this was compounded by the fact that Longhorn Vista took eons to get out the door. And then, once it was out the door it was a complete and total disaster. I mean, what a waste of code!

But really, as far as I’m concerned, Microsoft should have ended support for XP when Windows 7 came out, or shortly thereafter. Yes, I still use XP in my VMWare virtual machine for testing websites, but I don’t expect MS to keep supporting it, and I fully expect to need to upgrade soon.

Anyway, man! 13 years of supporting an OS. Anyone remember what the computer and tech landscape looked like in 2001? I’d say XP is _way_ long in the tooth!
