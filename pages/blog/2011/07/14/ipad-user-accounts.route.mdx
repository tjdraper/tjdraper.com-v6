If I had an iPad, I don’t think I would be rejoining the jailbreak scene just for this. With that said I’ve always thought user accounts on the iPad would be great. The problem is, the reason I want user accounts is so my wife and I could both use one iPad… Apple however wants to sell me two. So I’m not holding my breath for Apple to implement anything like this.
