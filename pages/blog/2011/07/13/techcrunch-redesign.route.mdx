_WARNING, LINK CONTAINS SOME FOUL LANGUAGE_

So I normally get annoyed with people who always hate site redesigns. And I mean, count on it, every time a designer at Facebook (for instance) sneezes, you’d think according to users that the world was crashing down around their ears.

And make no mistake, I think most of this hate over the TechCrunch redesign is completely stupid!

However, with that said, I’m personally not a fan of the redesign. Especially the logo! However, I’m not going to let my mild dislike of the new design keep me from reading anything on TC. And truthfully, I don’t see the site all that often. I have their RSS in my RSS reader, and if the article interests me, I might click through.

Still, it’s interesting to see everyone acting like their house was smashed in the middle of the night or something.
