Yeah, I’m a bit slow. I mean this came out yesterday! But I’ve been busy, working, driving on a trip etc.

Anyway, as usual, Siracusa’s review is thorough and I enjoyed it. He does spend a bit too much time lamenting the disappearance of the previously ever present scroll bar. I mean he does have a point, scrollers weren’t entirely useless, they conveyed to a user where you were at on a page. But the functionality wasn’t needed. I can’t remember the last time I scrolled by dragging a scroller. I always use my trackpad two-finger gesture, or single finger gesture on my magic mouse. And as for the telling where I’m at on a page, so far on Lion, I’m not missing having the scroller.

So yeah, he spends too much time on that, much as he used to on the OS X Finder.

And, truth be told, I did skim over some super technical stuff in the middle, but I would say I read 90% of the review.

Oh, and also, automatic word correction as I type this post from Safari 5.1 in Lion is AWESOME!
