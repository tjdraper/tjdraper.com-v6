Lately, I’ve been listening to two podcasts related to Apple stuff that I’ve really been enjoying. Allow me to share them with you.

They are, “Hypercritical” featuring John Siracusa, and “The Talk Show” featuring John Gruber.

John and Dan sometimes get carried away talking about movies at the end of “The Talk Show” but their commentary on the world of Apple is usually very enjoyable. And of course, though Siracusa can sometimes get a bit over my head, he’s also enjoyable to listen to talking about everything Apple.

These (and other podcasts I don’t yet know much about) can be found at [5by5.tv](http://5by5.tv)
