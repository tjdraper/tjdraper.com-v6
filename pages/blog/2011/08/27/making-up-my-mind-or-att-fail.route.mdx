I’ve been really, really busy trying to make ends meet, winning the bread, doing important things… all that stuff. Which is why I have not been posting on this blog I was once so eager to start.

So I decided a couple of days ago, if I cannot find time to post during the week I’ll at least post on Saturdays. I figured I would save a few RSS feeds that I wanted to blog about during the week but didn’t have time to, and blog about them on Saturday evening after I’ve finished my day’s work…

Well wouldn’t you know that today of all days, my DSL decides to go down. I called tech support and was after asking me a couple questions about the specific problems they put me on hold for 15 minutes (no joke, I’m not exaggerating). Finally someone comes back on the line and tells me that they cannot see my modem online, it is therefore not making a connection to their system (tell me something I don’t know!). They will be glad to send out a technician on Monday. MONDAY?!? I have work to do today, I’m paying for internet today. Why Monday? Well that’s the soonest anyone can get out here to diagnose and repair the problem.

So my only means of accessing the internet is via my iPhone, which I have steadfastly refused to pay an extra $20.00 a month for tethering on, so no internet to my computer. Additionally, AT&T still has not quite gotten their 3G out this far, so EDGE (2G) only.

It’s slow.

Really slow.

How slow? you ask.

So yeah, slow.

But, not to be deterred from my plan to post on Saturday evening, I am typing this on my iPhone with a Bluetooth keyboard!
