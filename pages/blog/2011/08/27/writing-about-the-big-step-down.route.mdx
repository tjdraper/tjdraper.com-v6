So I suppose I should write something about Steve stepping down from his position as CEO of Apple. That’s the big news this week (unless you’ve been living under a rock).

I don’t have a lot to say other than what everyone else has probably already said. But I will say that, from my perspective, Steve is probably the greatest CEO Apple has ever or will ever have. Indeed, some have said he is the greatest CEO of a company we have yet seen anywhere. I don’t know whether that’s true or not but he did bring back a company that was, for all practical purposes, already in the grave. Apple was done, they continually demonstrated an inability to innovate new products, or to provide an alternative to their aging operating system (arguably the lifeblood of Apple). I could write more about the OS, what many have considered to be the biggest part of Apple’s core, but this is about Steve.

Steve, against all odds, brought the company out of the graveyard, and not only that, he has brought the company into the forefront of the tech limelight. The company is doing extremely well thanks to Steve.

Steve oversaw the development of a new type of Mac that revolutionized the Macintosh design, the iMac. Steve oversaw the redesigning of NeXTSTEP into that powerful operating system know today as OS X (of which we are now on the eighth public release). He oversaw the development of the iPod and closely related, the iTunes Music Store ecosystem. He oversaw the starting of the Apple Store retail chain. He oversaw the development of the iPhone. He oversaw the development of the iPad.

All of these items are without a doubt some of the biggest technology successes of our time. Each item revolutionary. Each item affects almost everyone alive today in some form or fashion.

So what this amounts to is that I applaud Steve for his success, I thank him for the great Apple products that enable me to earn a living and have fun while doing it. And I wish him well as he moves on from the title of CEO.

And of course, this is not the end of Steve at Apple. He is now the chairman of the board at Apple and he will no doubt have a lot of input and oversight from there. But in some ways, it is the end of an era.

I hope that his vision for Apple will continue to live on.
