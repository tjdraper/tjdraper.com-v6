We’re having a pretty good thunderstorm right now. There’s something about a really good thunder and lightning storm that is just kind of awesome. And this one is pretty major in both the Thunder and lightning category. There were times when it seemed like the sky was just staying permanently lit up. I decided to try to capture this, at least to some extent, on my DSLR.

Despite the fact that it looked like the lightning was keeping the sky almost permanently lit up, it was surprisingly hard to capture. I probably took over 200 photos, and only these turned out to be worth anything.

Here’s one of the photos that didn’t capture anything.

Hey, I kinda caught something with this next one.

And then, I finally caught some lightning (too bad I didn’t have a bottle!)
