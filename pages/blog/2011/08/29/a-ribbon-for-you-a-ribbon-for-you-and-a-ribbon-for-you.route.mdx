Let me start off by making a surprising statement. I’ve had to use Windows 7 more than I ever wanted to lately. One thing has been apparent to me, though I would never want to give up the Mac OS X user experience which is still far superior, Windows 7 actually is a pretty good OS. I mean, I could and would actually use it in my day to day activities and not feel like I wanted to kill myself.

That sounded sort of back handed didn’t it? Well I really am trying here, but I have a hard time doing it.

Well anyway, Windows 7 is fairly well done. Having skipped Vista (and therefore having little experience with it except that it seemed like a pretty horrible OS), and sticking with XP as my Windows installation for when I need it, I was surprised to find that Windows 7 seems quite well done.

So with that said, I have some criticism of some new bit of info that has come out on Windows 8 UI. First of all, a little background on my frame of reference.

Just a couple weeks ago I said to myself, “Self! Your file browsing experience is looking a bit cluttered isn’t it? I mean, what do you really need the Finder to do?” For reference, here is what my default Finder view looked like at the time.

To be fair, sometimes I did (and still do) use the Finder in list view. What you see pictured above is column view. You see there are four primary views for Finder items. 1). Icon View (which I hate and never use except of course on my desktop). 2). List View (fairly useful, I use it about as often as number 3), 3). Column View (a favorite, especially in Lion now that I can arrange by kind and sort by name within kind). 4). Coverflow (essentially list view, with huge icons at the top that scroll horizontally. I do use it occasionally, mostly for pictures).

So, Finder has this neat feature where you can turn off all that visual clutter of toolbars and sidebars.

The result is a much less cluttered Finder.

I really like this. I still keep the path bar turned on at the bottom so I can see the path to the file(s) I am working with (this is more needful in list view than column view), and I still keep info turned on (which shows up close to the top of the window in this “no toolbar” view). And that’s it, everything else is about the files and folders I’m working with. If I need to delete something. I right click, or use the keyboard shortcut (which I usually did before anyway). Same if I need a new folder. If I want to switch between column or list view, I use the keyboard shortcut.

So that was my quest for less clutter.

So in that context, having just gone on that clutter cleaning quest I came across Microsoft’s sneak peak today of what Windows Explorer will be like in Windows 8. There was one feature that pegged the redline on my clutter meter. You ready…

THE RIBBON.

Yes the ribbon. It’s making it’s way to Windows Explorer… that awful, horrendous, heinous, plague of a UI concoction that brings fits of tears, screaming, and gnashing of teeth to users everywhere (but I’ll tell you what I really think in a minute). Here’s a sampling of what the ribbon looks like in Word.

Now, I’m a fairly experienced computer user. In fact I am somewhat of a geek. But to me, that ribbon just looks like a lot of visual clutter. Sure I know what all is there, I know what every single button does. But that blasted thing takes up a lot of screen real-estate, it’s doggone hideous, and it hurts my brain.

Here it is in Windows Explorer.

Mind = Blown.

I mean… they think this… is good UI design? I don’t understand.

And Marco Arment also has “some nice things to say” about it too: [I can’t find any evidence that this is a joke.](http://www.marco.org/2011/08/29/improvements-in-windows-explorer)

And I just have to say, I think Microsoft is in real trouble if they think this is good.
