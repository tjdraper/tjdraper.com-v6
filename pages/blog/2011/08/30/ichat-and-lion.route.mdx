I love Lion, but it’s not without it’s share of “new OS” bugs. One such bug I discovered quickly was that oftentimes, after either quitting iChat and then starting it back up at some later point in time, or putting my computer to sleep, and waking it up later, iChat will fail to log in again (at least with Google Talk, I don’t use any other IM mediums). And it’s really odd too, it doesn’t give any error messages, in fact it doesn’t appear to do anything. It just sits there with status set to “Offline.” If you instruct it to log in, either via the Status drop down, or from the drop down menu, it still shows no signs of life.

I had a little experience with this in some previous iteration of OS X (can’t remember which, but it did happen at some point from time to time), and the solution was to kill a process called ichatagent. So I immediately opened Activity Monitor and started looking for that process. No such process exists in Lion.

So I gave up and moved on for a few days. Then I ran across the solution somehow online. Apparently, ichatagent has been renamed to imagent.

So, to the tip. If you experience a situation where iChat will not connect, open Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities) and at the prompt type,

```
killall imagent
```

This will kill the imagent process (which is apparently hung, causing the issue with iChat). It will immediately restart, and iChat will log in.
