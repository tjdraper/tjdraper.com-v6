> Launch Mail and access its preferences by pressing Command+Comma (CMD+,). Click on the Viewing tab. You will see a section labeled View Conversations. Locate Include Related Messages and check it.

This is one of my favorite features of Mail 5’s conversation view and I can’t believe that it’s not enabled by default. That unfortunately means a lot of people won’t find that option because they don’t dig into the preferences. Being a pretty heavy email user I find it fairly common to need to reference what it was I said in a previous email.

Conversation view rocks, and being able to see your own replies right in line in the conversation view is even more awesome.
