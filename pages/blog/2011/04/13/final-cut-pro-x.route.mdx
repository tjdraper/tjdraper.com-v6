To get this out of the way… yes, just like OS X, the “X” is pronounced “Ten.” (And those of you who pronounce either any other way deserve for something very bad to happen to you, I don’t know what, but something).

So, as a professional video editor, how do I feel about FCP X?

First of all, I was not in Vegas at the Supermeet last night, so all I have to go on is the same Tweets, blog posts, and screen shots everyone else who wasn’t there has to go on.

That said, I certainly have some opinions on what I think I know.

Like any good geeky Final Cut editor, I followed all the news live. I followed [@fcpsupermeet](”http://twitter.com/fcpsupermeet”) on Twitter, and I exclaimed loudly at times about what I was reading (ask my wife, she’ll tell you).

Though I didn’t have time to do a blog post on the all the rumors and talk over the last 2 months or so, FCP X is more or less what I expected in general. Let me go through some of those more broadly:

-   Full program re-write in 64bit Cocoa
-   Pretty much new (if somewhat familiar) UI
-   Core Animation, Open CL, and Grand Central Dispatch support under the hood
-   Far better realtime capabilities
-   Full background rendering (no more render dialog)
-   Far better metadata support

These are the things I was expecting, and that Apple did indeed deliver. And I’m very much in favor of them! On every one of those items, I (and many others) said, “well it’s about time!” I mean, one of my favorite pastimes is to lament the lack of 64 bit Final Cut Pro and wonder when we will be able to access more than 4 gigs of RAM.

**UI** As much as I love Final Cut, it’s current UI was really starting to feel old and outdated. Like something out of the late ‘90s (because it **is** out of the late ‘90s). So I’m not at all opposed to the UI update. I do have my concerns with some of the aspects I was able to decipher of the new UI, but at the same time, I do have at least some amount of faith in Apple. We’ll just have to see how they have packaged some of the things I’m wondering about into the new UI (or made them outdated… or simply didn’t include them, like I say, we’ll see).

**Performance (Core Animation, Open CL, Grand Central)** Despite how fast and zippy my new Sandy Bridge equipped laptop is, it was painful to open activity monitor while rendering, or doing complex tasks in Final Cut, and watch the CPU monitor show only half the cores at less than 50%. It meant that Final Cut simply had no clue how to take advantage of this super speedy computer, and that it takes unnecessarily long to render and output things. The performance improvements mentioned in FCP X will be much welcomed!

**Realtime** Realtime in Final Cut has always been a major weak point. This is quite welcome!

**No More waiting for rendering** Banished is the “Writing Video” progress bar. And I will not lament it’s demise! Again, **it’s about time!**

**Metadata** I’m already tired of writing “it’s about time,” but seriously… I mean this is going to be awesome!

Now, some things that I wasn’t necessarily expecting, I really just didn’t know or hadn’t thought about.

-   Magnetic Timeline
-   Compound Clips
-   Inline Precision Editor
-   Auditioning
-   Timeline Index
-   Less keyframing, smarter fade handles etc.
-   Color Matching
-   Better organization
-   Release as Single App on App store

I’m not going to go through these, they are pretty self explanatory for the most part. I will say these are all welcome additions. I see nothing to be concerned about here, and I can’t wait to get my hands on these features.

So, is there anything I’m concerned about, or have additional thoughts on? Yes, I’m glad you asked, there are indeed.

**Concern Number One** First, and less of a concern, more of an “Ugh” is the fact that I will have to re-learn a lot of things. New UI, new workflows, I’m sure things that I’ve grown dependent on will be entirely different or MIA. I can adjust, I can adapt, I always do, and I always will. But I have sometimes come to hate software transitions. I think they can be easier at some times than others, but I don’t think this is going to be one of the easier transitions. This is software I use **every day** for my livelihood. My career and expertise is based largely on Final Cut Pro. I have a lot of learned behaviors and habits that will take some time to break and/or re-learn.

So as I said, the first one here is really more of a sigh.

**Concern Number Two** There are a lot of unanswered questions. What about filters, tape capture, text tools, color tools, motion tab control tools, existing plugin support, compositing, video scopes. That’s just to name a few. I have a few guesses on these, but we won’t really know for a little while yet.

**Concern Number Three** What hardware is supported.

**Concern Number Four** What about media management. As far as I can tell, Apple did not talk about it at all.

One of my main gripes about Final Cut Pro from the very beginning has been it’s weak media management support. One simple thing they could do that would cure 75% of this is to make scratch disks a project setting, and not a system wide setting (unless they’ve somehow made this paradigm obsolete in the new Final Cut, which I don’t see how they could have).

**Concern Number Five** I’ve already touched on this, but I’ll mention it in the official list and expound. Is it still truly a “Pro” app? Have we lost anything, given anything up in the transition to this rebuilt application? Will it still serve all my needs as a professional video editor?

Time will tell.

**Concern Number Six** What about the rest of the Final Cut Studio? What about Motion, DVD Studio Pro, Soundtrack Pro, and Compressor?

The official line from Apple is basically, more info soon.

So, it’s all very exciting, and as a professional who lives off this stuff, a little bit scary. Right now, we’ll just have to wait and see how things develop.
