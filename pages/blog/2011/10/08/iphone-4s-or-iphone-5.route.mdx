John Gruber asks, [WHAT MORE COULD YOU HAVE WANTED IN A HYPOTHETICAL ‘IPHONE 5’ TODAY?](http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/thoughts_and_observations_iphone_4s)

It’s a fair question. I don’t get why people are so upset. What’s not to like about the iPhone 4 form factor? The Antennae? They [“fixed” that](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/04/iphone-4s-includes-significant-antenna-upgrades/) (Not that I think it was really broken in the first place, this is just a natural progression of antennae improvement).

The screen size?

Gruber:

> A 4-INCH SCREEN? What sign has Apple ever given that it will ever change from the one-size-fits-all 3.5-inch screen? Every single iPhone and iPod Touch ever released has had the exact same size screen.
>
> Now, maybe you would prefer a 4-inch screen. Or maybe a 4.5-inch screen. And maybe someone else would prefer a slightly smaller 3.25-inch screen. That’s not how Apple rolls, especially with iOS devices. There is no doubt that some people would prefer a bigger screen. But nor is there any doubt that many other people would not. I wouldn’t. I like to see things get smaller, not bigger. Bigger is not necessarily better. Apple decided on the optimal size for an iPhone display back in 2006. If they thought 4-inches was better, overall, as the one true size for the iPhone display, then the original iPhone would have had a 4-inch display. It’s not like 4-inch screens are harder to make, or use some sort of new technology. If anything they’re surely easier to make, as the pixels are less dense.

> One big advantage of a 3.5-inch display: with average-size hands, [your thumb can reach any pixel on screen more comfortably](http://dcurt.is/2011/10/03/3-point-5-inches/) while holding the phone one-handed. Judging from my email, many proponents of bigger screens — those who are disappointed that the iPhone 4S doesn’t sport a 4-inch display — see no such trade-off. Bigger is better, period, they say, and anyone who says otherwise is in denial that Apple is falling behind its competition. But by that logic, 5-inch screens would be better than 4-inch ones, and 6-inch screens better still. That’s silly. Bigger is not necessarily better for handheld/pocket devices.

I know I don’t want my iPhone to be any larger. And the point about being able to reach the whole screen is well taken. I often use my iPhone one handed, it’s hard to do on some of these huge android devices. If I want a bigger device I’ll get an iPad. This is just another example of how well Apple thinks through these things whereas other manufacturers are simply focused on adding more and more features, bigger, better, faster, at any cost! Apple goes so many levels beyond that in it’s thinking.

So what would you want in an “iPhone 5.” From what I can tell, people just wanted the name to be iPhone 5. But it looks to me, as others have observed, that Apple is setting a pattern here, starting with the iPhone 3G/3GS, and now with the iPhone 4/4S. Design a great phone, iterate the internals in the next revision. And make no mistake, the upgrade from 4 to 4S in terms of performance, and even a few features is huge.

Also let’s consider the typical wireless customer in our day and age. Good phones, smart phones, are way too expensive for most of us to buy outright. Carriers subsidize them so that we only pay a portion of what those phones actually cost. Carriers recoup the cost over the life of the contract. To compound matters, there are not two different types of plans, subsidized phone plans in which you pay more for your service plan and less for your phone, and unsubsidized phone service, where you bring your own device and get service for less. That simply doesn’t exist, so bringing your own unlocked device doesn’t make any sense. You pay **more** since you pay for an unsubsidized phone and still pay the same amount for wireless service.

The point of course is that all of us buy subsidize phones and sign two year service contracts. I bought a first generation iPhone and signed a two year contract. I understood what I was doing and I was not upset when I was not eligible for subsidized upgrade pricing to the iPhone 3G, I was on a **two year contract**. It’s not hard to understand. And I didn’t really even want to. My plan from the beginning was to buy a new phone every two years, just as we have pretty much always done in the wireless phone system.

I bought a 3GS on launch day and handed down my original iPhone to my wife. Again, my plan was to _not_ buy an iPhone 4, but to buy the next version (iPhone 4S). I think Apple understands this about the wireless industry and is working with it. If I had an iPhone 4, I would not really be tempted to upgrade to an iPhone 4S. The iPhone 4 is a fine phone. The same as when the iPhone 4 came out, I was not majorly tempted to ditch my 3GS and buy a 4. I believe Apple is working with the 2 year contracts in the industry and not against that system. Every upgrade has been a nice upgrade, but skipping a generation every other year is not _that_ hard to do.
