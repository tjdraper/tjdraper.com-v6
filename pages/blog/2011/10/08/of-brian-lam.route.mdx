**Warning, the link contains some vulgar language, including the title of the article itself.** But I found the humility and confession of wrongdoing refreshing after the whole incident that went down with Gizmodo.

As I said, this is refreshing, and I’m glad that there seems to be confirmation that Steve received the apology and reportedly called it “Water under the bridge” for Brian’s sake.

For my part, I started boycotting Gizmodo, and all other Gawker sites as soon after this started going down. The whole thing was so unprofessional and mishandled by Gizmodo. As Steve said in Brian’s post above:

> “I appreciate you had your fun with our phone and I’m not mad at you, I’m mad at the sales guy who lost it. But we need the phone back because we can’t let it fall into the wrong hands.”

The problem was not that Gizmodo ran the initial story even as Steve acknowledged. It was a big deal, and Gizmodo is a news/rumor site. It was fun. But they took the whole thing above and beyond the point of good fun and “breaking news, lost iPhone.”

I’m glad that Brian has done the right thing. I appreciate his post. And it is a reminder to us all to always evaluate how we conduct ourselves both personally and professionally.
