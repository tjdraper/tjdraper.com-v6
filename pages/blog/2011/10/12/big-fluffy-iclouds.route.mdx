It’s been a pretty big day for Apple what with the numerous software updates and the launch of iCloud. And there’s lots of reports circling around that Apple’s servers are completely overloaded. But that’s pretty much as expected. It’s like everyone going to the bank at once to withdraw all their money… don’t think about that for too long, you might get sick.

Anyway, the big news is of course iOS 5. I’ve been running the Gold Master for a week or so and I really love it (and of course, that means I beat the rush to download iOS 5 today at it’s public release). I’m not sure how I ever survived without non-disruptive notifications, but anyone who reads my stuff already knew that I hated those old modal pop-up notifications. All in all, I’d have to say iOS 5 is about the most stable initial release of iOS I have ever upgraded to, which speaks to the fact that iOS is quickly maturing as a platform. I do still have some nitpicking to do, which I may get to soon.

Secondly, Apple has launched iCloud as the successor to MobileMe. I personally haven’t had any issues with MobileMe since all the initial launch day issues, but rebranding as iCloud will ultimately help Apple I think since MobileMe was perceived so badly because of the bungled launch. Even if iCloud didn’t get renamed and remained MobileMe but had the same backend and functionality as iCloud now has, the perception would be different. Now Apple can say, “No, see, we started over, iCloud is completely new and better, etc. And truthfully from what I’m given to understand, though the services that are common to both Mobile Me and iCloud seem very identical, I hear there was a lot of work on the back end to make things behave a lot better. Time will tell. I did migrate this evening from MobileMe to iCloud. There does seem to be occasional hiccups and slowness, but I believe that to be from the incredible strain Apple’s servers are under trying to keep up with everyone and their brother updating and migrating.

Then there’s the AirPort Utility for iOS which clearly says, “Hey, we’re moving in this PCless direction, and now you don’t need a PC to manage your AirPort. Just like iOS 5 now no longer requires being plugged in to iTunes to get started.

Apple released other things today, but these to me are the biggest things.
