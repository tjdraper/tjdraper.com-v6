> We’ve set Google’s brand new flagship Android phone, the Samsung-built Galaxy Nexus, against Apple’s latest and greatest, the iPhone 4S. Below you’ll find a gallery showing how they differ in size, screen brightness, and color temperature, plus a second set of pictures taken with the two phones side by side.

You know, people tell me all the time how biased I am, and maybe I am. But I keep looking at that HUGE phone and wondering how people can stand it? The iPhone is big enough in my pocket. I honestly do not believe I would want a device to be any bigger. I’m not sure the Galaxy Nexus would even fit in my pocket. I mean seriously, this is not a tablet, it’s a PHONE!
