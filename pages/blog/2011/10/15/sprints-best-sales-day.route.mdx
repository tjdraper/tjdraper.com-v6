> “Sprint today reported its best ever day of sales in retail, web and telesales for a device family in Sprint history with the launch of iPhone 4S and iPhone 4.

But, but… Android, I mean… Android is better than iPhone right? Sprint has had Android for a long time! And yet iPhone comes to Sprint and they are swamped.

As I have said before, I think the only reason Android has gained the foothold that it has was because of the lack of carrier choice for iPhone. I think now we are starting to see consumer choice a little more clearly now that carrier options have opened up.
