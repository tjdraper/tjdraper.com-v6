Apple did not give the iPhone 3GS HDR capabilities so this is my first chance to play with it.

Now I know HDR has its detractors, and I certainly think the concept can be overused and overdone. No one wants a flat looking photo (or they shouldnâ€™t).

However, HDR can really help in the following situation:

![iPhone_4S,_photos_and_HDR](/assets/uploads/iPhone_4S,_photos_and_HDR-1.png) no HDR

![iPhone_4S,_photos_and_HDR-2](/assets/uploads/iPhone_4S,_photos_and_HDR-2.png) with HDR

So as you can see, HDR brought a lot of detail to that photo that was otherwise lost. Pretty awesome stuff!
