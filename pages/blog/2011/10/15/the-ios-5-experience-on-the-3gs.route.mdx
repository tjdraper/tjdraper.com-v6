> The thing to talk about then is how the 3GS performs with this latest OS installed. I’ve been using the 3GS with the iOS 5 betas for a good month now and how it will end up running depends a lot on how you use your device (no surprise there). Minimal app users who don’t do that much surfing will probably get by quite well, but I’ve found that switching too frequently between 6–10 apps throughout the day can slow the whole device down.

So, I’m not the only one that noticed this on the 3GS. He goes on to discuss how you aren’t supposed to worry about managing apps with iOS, the system should close apps for you as it sees fit, but as Thomas found in this article, and as I found, that’s just not the case with the 3GS (I will say I haven’t noticed a problem on the 4S yet).

I disagree with Thomas however toward the end of the article about the 3GS having lost some of its trademark speediness with each OS update. My 3GS was definitely faster with iOS 5. I think as faster and better phones come out our perception of the 3GS’ performance is what changes.
