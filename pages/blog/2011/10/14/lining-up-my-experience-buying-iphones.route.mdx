**The Original iPhone**

The first time I stood in line on launch day for an iPhone was the day the original iPhone came out. Strangely, that first iPhone went on sale at 6:00 PM on a Friday. So I got off work and hightailed it to the AT&T store in Franklin (the Apple store is quit a bit further away). I was joined by a good friend of mine. I was pretty far in the back of the line of course, getting there at 5:45. To my great disappointment, they sold out while I was still 10 to 12 people back (I don’t think Apple or AT&T had any idea just how hot this product would be at the time, and I mean how could you really gauge something like that when the product is just coming onto the market). But the AT&T rep did tell me there was still lots of iPhones at their AT&T store in Lawrenceburg (over an hour drive). Being the Apple nerd that I am, I decided to go. My friend decided not to but asked me to get one for him if there were still any left when I got there. Another friend called me on the way to ask the same.

Well there wasn’t anyone there buying iPhones when I got there, so I bought one (and the two others)… and promptly waited 2 days for activation. You see, AT&T just wasn’t prepared for the onslaught on their activations servers. But I did eventually get that phone activated, and loved it.

**iPhone 3GS**

I skipped the iPhone 3G. I upgrade every two years you see. So I next stood in line for the 3GS. I can’t remember the day of the week, but I do remember I was starting a vacation period at work that day and I was taking off from the Apple store on a trip. I got there pretty early, 5:00 AM if memory serves, and got a fairly good spot in line. But before I go on, one important detail. Apple had a system at that time whereby you would “reserve” your new iPhone for purchase and pickup at the Apple Store on launch day. I went through this process the day the 3GS was announced and got my confirmation email. Just for safety, I printed this out and took it with me this day.

Well, as it turns out, what with all the influx of orders hammering Apple’s servers, mine had gotten messed up somehow. My iPhone was not reserved. That year they had two lines, one for “reserved” customers, and one for the customers who had not reserved a phone. So I got shuffled over to the line for non-reserved customers, and waited much longer than I would have had they not messed up my reservation. I was a bit peeved, but I did get my 3GS, and activation was no trouble this time. Yet it was obvious that some streamlining needed to be done.

**iPhone 4S**

I got up this morning at 3:55 AM. I showered quickly, jumped in the car and was on the road for my 45 minute drive to the Apple Store Green Hills by 4:18 AM. I arrived just after 5:00 and got approximately the same spot in line that I got when I stood in line for the 3GS. This year there were no reservations. I think Apple gave that up as a bad job.

This year however, Apple reps starting making their way through the line at about 6:20 AM or so. They asked what phone we wanted, size, color, carrier, then gave us a card with a number, and indications of the specs we just described.

Not long after this, more Apple reps came with iPads having us fill out all our details, making sure we were eligible for upgrade if we were upgrading, or if ineligible, knew it would cost us an arm and a leg. I got through AT&T’s upgrade process and info easily, handed the iPad back to the rep and she moved on.

At 7:56 AM, the doors opened, Apple employees were cheering, and several at the front of the line entered. I slowly made my way up so that at about 8:25 I was greeted by an Apple rep. We went in to the store, I handed my card over, they got an iPhone, entered the number from the card, scanned the barcode on my phone’s box, and in about 30 seconds, my 3GS lost service. I selected a case for my new iPhone and a screen protector, we pulled my phone out and turned it on. It immediately registered on AT&T’s network as my phone, even while I was going through setup and iCould restore (apparently, I _just_ beat the influx of traffic that would later this day bring AT&T’s activation servers to a grinding halt).

At about 8:45 I was walking out the door. I called my wife on my knew iPhone and made my way to work.

So the point of all this (other than the obvious geekery about standing in line, and all the fun that is) is that Apple is definitely streamlining this process. This was by far my best launch day iPhone purchase. This is why I love Apple and their products.
