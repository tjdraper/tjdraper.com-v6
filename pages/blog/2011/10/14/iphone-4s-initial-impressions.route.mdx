It’s fast. VERY FAST.

I discussed in a previous post how I would close running apps on my 3GS, otherwise the lagginess would become unacceptable… That does not appear to be an issue with the 4S so far.

I only just recently switched to iCloud, but it worked flawlessly. My 3GS backed up last night as I slept, and at the Apple store we pulled my new 4S out of the box, I entered my iCloud account info, and my phone restored from my most recent iCloud backup.

It did take longer than it would have had I been using iTunes, but not having to lug my laptop to the Apple Store with me makes it worth it.

All in all it took 12 minutes or so. Had I chosen to hang out on Apple’s WiFi network, it would have reinstalled all my apps over the air too. I chose to leave the Apple store and continue that process later over USB.

All in all, Apple is definitely perfecting the iPhone experience.

Oh, and having come from the 3GS, let me just say that the Retina Display is amazing! Going back to my 3GS for a few moments, it feels all blurry and hard to see now.
