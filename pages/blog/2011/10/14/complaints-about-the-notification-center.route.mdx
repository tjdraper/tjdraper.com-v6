I only agree with one of the complaints that he lists, which is the last one.

> All of this really leads to the most annoying part of the new Notification Center: the fact that there is no indication, or notification anywhere that there are still notifications in the Notification Center.

Yeah, I find that really annoying too. While Notification Center is a huge step forward in terms of making sure I can see older notifications, it’s only useful so long as I remember to pull it down and see what’s in there. I was really hoping for an icon in the status bar to let me know there are still notifications I need to look at.
