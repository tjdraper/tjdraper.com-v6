I’m in general quite happy with iCloud. iCloud has everything I actually used from MobileMe, and it seems to all “just work” even a little better than MobileMe.

But the one thing in iCloud I didn’t realize would be such a big deal is Photo Stream. I haven’t connected my iPhone to my computer to load photos into iPhoto once since upgrading to iCloud. iPhone just sucks my photos from Photo Stream in and imports them. It’s really awesome.

One thing of note, by default any photos you add to iPhoto from other sources also get automatically put in your photo stream. I turned this off because I just don’t care about that. So basically, Photo Stream for me is my iPhone uploading the photos from my iPhone camera roll, which automagically gets imported into iPhoto.

This is a big deal to me because I would only occasionally and grudgingly import my iPhone photos into iPhoto and organize them. Now Photo Stream, combined with the great camera on the iPhone 4S (which makes it much more likely that I’ll take a picture on my phone when I otherwise wouldn’t have), makes life that much easier.

I’m calling this one a win for Apple as far as I’m concerned.
