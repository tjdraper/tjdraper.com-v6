> From BusyCal’s “Upgrading to iCloud” support page:
> 
> > iCloud calendars are type-specific. Each iCloud calendar may contain either Events or To Dos, but not both. When you move your calendars to iCloud, each calendar will be split into two calendars — one for Events and one for To Dos.
> 
> This was a source of confusion for me, because iCal doesn’t list reminder-only calendars as separate calendars, but BusyCal and certain other CalDAV clients do.
> 
> E.g., with MobileMe, I had one calendar named “John”. When I upgraded from MobileMe to iCloud, that calendar was split in two — one for events, one for reminders — but both were named “John”. BusyCal shows two calendars, but iCal still shows just one. The app that handles this best is — perhaps unsurprisingly — the web-based iCloud Calendar app. There, calendars and reminder lists [are presented in the source list as discrete items](http://daringfireball.net/misc/2011/10/icloud-calendar-sourcelist.gif).

I’m generally happy with iCloud, but this was definitely a source of confusion for me as well. It was a couple days before I figured out what was going on because iCal does not display the calendars separately in a way that makes sense, and Reminders on iPhone doesn’t make it easy to figure out how to edit “lists” either. It’s a little frustrating that such an oversight made it into the finished iCloud product.
