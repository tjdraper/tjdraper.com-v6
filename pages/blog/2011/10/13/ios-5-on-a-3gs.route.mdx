The only iDevice I have which is compatible with iOS 5 is my 3GS, my wife’s 1st generation iPhone (formerly my iPhone) not being capable of running an OS newer than version 3. The 3GS is two years old now, but I still find it to be acceptable (though truthfully I’m looking forward to upgrading to a 4S as soon as I can pull together some green stuff).

iOS 5 runs acceptably well on the 3GS and as far as I know does not have any feature limitations that differentiate it from iOS 5 running on an iPhone 4 (neither the 3GS nor the 4 will have access to Siri, that will be a 4S only feature).

**Notifications**

My vote for best new feature is hands down the new notification system. I have lamented before the state of iOS notifications. Apple neglected this area of the OS for far too long and it was the one area where I genuinely felt Android had an edge on iOS. Admittedly Apple’s solution does look quite familiar. But if something has been done, and done well, why reinvent it. So we gained two major, MAJOR improvements.

1.  Banner notifications

This is Instead of the disruptive modal pop-ups which required some action from the user, either close the notification, or open the offending app. The new banners, on the other hand, don’t get in the way (much), offer you a 5 second or so preview of the notification, then quietly dismiss themselves.

1.  Notification Center

This is an area where notifications that haven’t been acted upon are kept. If you are busy playing Dead Runner, Brick 3D, Sonic the Hedgehog, Super Monkey Ball, RAGE… well anyway, whatever you are doing, should you choose to ignore the notification, you can come back to it later by placing a finger at the top of your iPhone screen and pulling down. Notification Center drops down and shows you ignored notifications. You can clear them from here, or you can tap on one to go to the app from whence the notification came, which will also clear it (or, if you see a badge on an app from the home screen, and visit the app from there, the notification will be cleared).

**Camera**

Runner up for best feature is accessibility to the camera from the lock screen. I often found before that when I wanted to capture a moment with my camera, by the time I got the phone unlocked, got to the correct home screen, located the camera app and launched it, that I had missed my opportunity. In iOS 5, double clicking the home button causes a camera button to appear next to the “slide to unlock” area. Tap the camera button and you are ready for action. I suspect I’ll be using my iPhone camera a lot more now.

**iMessage**

I have several friends that updated to the Gold Master of iOS 5 early as I did. We have been enjoying iMessage. And, as advertised, it just works. When you go to text someone, iOS checks to see if the recipient has iOS 5 as well. If it does, the “send” button changes from green (SMS) to blue, and the text field says “iMessage” in it. This means it will not be sent via SMS using your carrier’s network, but will instead be sent via Apple’s free iMessage service. I sent more ~texts~ iMessages to these friends in a week, than I’ve ever sent in a month before.

So I’m loving iMessage. I only hope that Apple will also integrate it on the Mac, possibly with iChat.

**Wi-Fi Sync**

It’s pretty awesome to be able to sync my phone without the need to rummage around for my cable. And that’s pretty self explanatory so I shall move on.

**iCloud**

Yeah, iCloud probably deserves it’s own write up, but it’s also a big part of iOS 5. Unfortunately I don’t have much to say because I have only just this evening migrated my MobileMe account to iCloud. But in theory, it’s all the features from MobileMe I actually used, for free. And then adds documents in the cloud. So in theory I love it.

**Week View**

It’s a small thing, but orienting your iPhone to landscape while you are in calendar gives you a week view. This is a VERY good thing.

**Stability**

This is definitely the most stable any version of iOS has ever been at launch. If anything it feels more stable than iOS 4 was already. Things seem faster, animations seem less likely to lag, Safari seems faster, I haven’t had to restart my phone in days (something that seems necessary every other day with iOS 4 due to general lagginess after a couple days).

**Gripes**

My biggest gripe with iOS continues to be that I don’t think it’s nearly aggressive enough in it’s memory management. The user is not supposed to need to worry about closing apps or any such thing. In theory, if iOS needs memory, it closes apps starting with those that haven’t been used in the longest period of time. As I say, in theory, this is great because it means that the last couple apps you launched will be frozen in the background, in RAM, waiting for you to come back and use them. Since they haven’t actually closed, but were just frozen, they resume almost instantly when you reactivate them.

However, I have always found in iOS 4, that if I never manually closed applications, my phone would get almost unusable pretty quickly. Things get laggy, keyboard gets unresponsive, apps take a long time to reactivate, things crash. In short, it seems to me that iOS is just not closing applications in the background as readily as it should. I will sometimes see how long I can go without closing apps, and it doesn’t take long at all. So I usually stay in the habit of simply opening the app tray, and closing apps when I am sure I am done with them.

And I am sad to report this does not seem changed at all in iOS 5.

It’s kind of a small thing, but it’s irritating because Apple’s official line is, “don’t worry about closing apps, iOS will take care of it for you.” But it just doesn’t seem to work that way for me.

**In Conclusion**

But in closing, iOS 5 is a great upgrade and I’m quite happy with it. As far as I’m concerned, while iOS 4 was already better than Android in most ways, iOS 5 blows way past Android and takes a major lead.

Now, let’s get the rumor mill started on iOS 6! ![wink](wink.gif)
