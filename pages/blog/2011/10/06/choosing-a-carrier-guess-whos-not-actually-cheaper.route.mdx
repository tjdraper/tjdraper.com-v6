  Choosing a carrier, guess who's not actually cheaper…

So now I have 3 iPhone carriers to choose from here in the U.S. I [said back in March](http://appleuserpro.com/home/att-or-verizon) that I didn’t feel a burning need to upgrade to the new iPhone this year. I was assuming of course that Apple would follow it’s typical release schedule with a new iPhone in June or July.

I’m ready to upgrade now, and the 4S looks mighty fine.

I also lamented the state of AT&T’s coverage in the post linked above, but also lamented Verizon’s expense compared to AT&T. For me at least, the savings of being with AT&T over Verizon are at this point pretty big.

Consider:

**Verizon**

- Cheapest Family Plan - 700 Minutes for $69.99
- Cheapest Smartphone Data Plan - 2 GB for $30.00 (x2 since all smartphones must have data plans and my wife has a smartphone)
- Second Line - $9.99


This adds up to roughly $140.00 per month before taxes.

**Sprint**

- Cheapest Family Plan (unless I’m missing something) - 1500 Minutes for $149.99
- Smartphone Data Plan - Included
- Second Line - unknown


So Sprint is at least $150.00 per month for me. Isn’t Sprint suppose to be cheaper or something?!? Also, they don’t have native coverage in my home area (they do in my work area). And, from what I’ve been able to gather, while Sprint can voice roam on Verizon at no charge to me (as long as I don’t go over 50% of my minutes very often), Verizon doesn’t let Sprint have access to 3G EVDO so it’s 2G data only. While it wasn’t true a couple years ago, I think AT&T may now have more 3G coverage than Sprint’s native 3G coverage.

Basically, for my needs I’m ruling out Sprint.

**AT&T**

- Cheapest Family Plan - 550 Minutes for $59.99
- Cheapest Smartphone Data Plan - 200 MB for $15.00. This is good for my wife’s iPhone
- Smartphone Data Plan for me - 2GB for $25.00. This is the plan I have to have, I use way more than 200 MB
- Second Line - $9.99


$110. Clearly, at least for my situation, AT&T is significantly less expensive. And more importantly, I can budget the AT&T bill, I can’t make the budget work for the other two (yes at this point in my life, money is that tight). So as much as I would **LOVE** to switch to Verizon, I just can’t. So irritatingly, I believe I will be sticking with AT&T.
