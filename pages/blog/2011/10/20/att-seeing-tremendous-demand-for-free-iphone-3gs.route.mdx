> In a conference call with analysts this afternoon, Ralph de la Vega, President and CEO of AT&T Mobility discussed the impact of the recent price drop on older-generation iPhones, particularly the iPhone 3GS. That phone is the first iPhone be offered free with 2-year contract in the U.S.

Making the 3GS free on contract is really a brilliant move by Apple. The 3GS is actually still a really decent phone and anyone remotely interested in a smart phone of any kind would be crazy not to consider it. The only downside right now is that the 3GS was, is, and will only ever be a GSM/UMTS (AT&T) phone. Next year however, if they make the iPhone 4 free on contract, it will open that up to all U.S. carriers.

And there seems to be a lot of demand for the free 3GS. Since I was signing a contract on my iPhone 4S anyway, I decided to get my wife a new 3GS on contract rather than hand down my 2 year old 3GS with a crack in the back. I was surprised to learn on Saturday at the AT&T store that they were completely sold out (we did manage to get her one at the Apple Store, Green Hills). That tells me that there was a lot of interest in a free iPhone. So by that reckoning, Apple (and AT&T) are probably selling many more iPhones than they would have otherwise. It’s really a win/win/win.

It’s a win for Apple because they are selling a phone that has been in production for 2 years now, which means the cost of manufacturing is considerably less than it was, and they are still getting subsidies from AT&T for every “free on contract” 3GS sold.

It’s a win for AT&T because they are pulling in 2 year smartphone contracts with many more people who otherwise would have gotten dumb phones (no data plan, therefore less money for AT&T).

And it’s a win for the consumer. I’ve seen people griping about how it’s not really that good of a deal because of how much you pay over the life of your contract. But the fact of the matter is that no matter what you pay for your phone, the monthly fees are the same. So a free phone, is still a free phone.
