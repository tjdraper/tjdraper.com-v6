This comic illustrates a **major** pet peeve of mine. I really cannot stand it when I click a link on my iPhone, and I am re-directed, **not** to the mobile version of that article, but to the site in question’s home page. That has to be the worst experience you can give your mobile web traffic. And in a lot of cases, say I’ve saved an article link to read later, I may be clicking through after the period of time when that article is easily accessible from the website’s home page.

I do some site development, and it’s not that hard to dynamically serve an iPhone version of a page or a desktop version of a page **without** redirection.

So web developers take note, when you do that to your mobile clicks, I think in almost every case, you are really ticking off your user base.
