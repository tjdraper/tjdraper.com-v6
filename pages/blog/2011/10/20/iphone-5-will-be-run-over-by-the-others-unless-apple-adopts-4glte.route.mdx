Here we go again:

> Tommy Ljunggren is senior vice president of Swedish wireless operator TeliaSonera and he’s got some “nice” words about mobile prospects of his valued partner, Apple. Ljunggren told Telecoms.com that Apple is no longer as relevant a factor in mobile as it used to be, saying the company is set for failure unless the next iPhone adopts chips that support fourth-generation cellular networks based on Long Term Evolution radio technology, being deployed by carriers around the world:

> > If you asked me two years ago I would have said Apple would be very important. But now it will be a bad mistake not to include LTE in the iPhone 5 as otherwise they will really be run over by the others. Apple are not unique enough and there is disappointment over the 4S – it was too small step for them.

“In my not so great opinion here is what Apple must do or die!!!1!!1!!!!” Does this strike anyone else as attention grabbing?

Whether Apple includes LTE in the next iPhone, which I give a 50/50 chance by the way, it will set sales records yet again, like every iPhone before it.

The common consumer doesn’t care that much about LTE. I mean, I’m pretty techy and I don’t care that much about it. Don’t get me wrong, it will be important as we move forward, but at this point, and for the next couple of years I’ll be satisfied to watch it grow, and for chipsets to become less power hungry.

In short, Apple and iPhone will be just fine either way.
