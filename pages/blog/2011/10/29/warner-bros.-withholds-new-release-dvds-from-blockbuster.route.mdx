> There is a 28-day industry standard between the date that DVDs go on sale and the date they are available to stream. Warner Bros. is trying to force that same window on Blockbuster. Blockbuster has been pushing against this 28-day window as a way to beat streaming rental services and establish itself as a go-to for early rentals.
> 
> Movie studios, however, are not taking so kindly to Blockbuster’s business move, with Warner Bros. the first to crack the whip. Tensions flared when Blockbuster put up rentals of Horrible Bosses and The Green Lantern earlier than the 28-day window without Warner Bros.’s permission, reported Josh Halliday at The Guardian.
> 
> Blockbuster will fight back by simply buying Warner Bros. movies when they come out and placing them for rent. This is obviously a risky strategy considering the rental chain is used to getting films at wholesale. And it certainly won’t put Blockbuster in the studio’s good graces.

Break out the popcorn, this is getting good.
