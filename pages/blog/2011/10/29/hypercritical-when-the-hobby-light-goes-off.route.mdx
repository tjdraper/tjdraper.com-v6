> John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin discuss what it’s going to take for Apple to field a television product that’s finally something more than a “hobby.” Attached box vs. full TV set, apps vs. channels vs. a la carte purchases, direct deals with content owners vs. additional layers of middlemen (e.g., Netflix). So many possibilities, but all of them difficult.

I’m only about 35 minutes in to this episode of Hypercritical, but I wanted to post about this today and don’t foresee finishing the episode before the day is out…

As usual, Siracusa’s analysis is great. He makes good arguments both ways for whether Apple would or would not make a full television set or just continue with the connected box strategy.

I have been of the opinion up to this point that it would probably not make a lot of sense from Apple’s point of view to make a full television set, and for many of the same reasons Dan and John discuss in this podcast (people don’t “upgrade” TVs that often, what would Apple bring to this market that would be both better and affordable, as well as compelling etc.). But one thing struck me as I was listening, TV interfaces are horrible. Sure, maybe you don’t have to mess with it too much if your Apple TV box is set for the TV’s primary input, but even so, as some point you have to navigate through the mire of the TV interface and menu system. 2,500 inputs and outputs, 15 submenu levels (all in geek speak), 15,000 different settings. I can’t tell you how many times I have seen wide screen HD TVs displaying 16x9 content… **letterboxed**. Ugh! It’s squished, and people just don’t know any better, don’t know how to set it up etc. It’s precisely because of the complexity of the TV interface. What Apple could bring to the party is their brilliant interface design.

It should be noted that I’m not arguing that this is what Apple will do. In fact at this point the arguments for and against seem equally strong to me and I just can’t tell which way Apple will go. Time will tell.
