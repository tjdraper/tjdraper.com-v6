> Imagine a world in which any intellectual property holder can, without ever appearing before a judge or setting foot in a courtroom, shut down any website’s online advertising programs and block access to credit card payments. The credit card processors and the advertising networks would be required to take quick action against the named website; only the filing of a “counter notification” by the website could get service restored.

This is scary stuff. Our infatuation with intellectual property laws, and the continued push to turn the Internet into the digital equivalent of the drug wars is beyond my ability to comprehend, and yet that’s exactly where we are heading. The patent and copyright system is so unbelievably broken that it’s frightening, and instead of fixing it, we’re going down tha path of making it a far bigger problem. This is insanity!
