So having [posted the one good thing](/blog/2011/10/24/att-call-clarity) I can think of about AT&T, I also have to post something bad about AT&T. So for the next several weeks I’ll be working at a particular location in Franklin where AT&T cell service is worse than the mediocre cell service in other parts of Franklin. It’s maddening because it’s not like I’m in the middle of nowhere.

Outside the building where I am working I get 4 (of 5) bars. Inside the office, right by a window to the outside, I get 2 bars if my iPhone is sitting on my desk. If I pick up the phone to make or take a call, the call cuts in and out, sometimes it will drop. It’s completely unacceptable.

Thankfully, I have a MicroCell (pictured above) which I was able to “deploy” here to fix AT&T’s abysmal and unacceptable coverage. But I should not have to do that. And this is why I was so torn (and bummed) at the cost difference between Verizon and AT&T.

I guess you get what you pay for.
