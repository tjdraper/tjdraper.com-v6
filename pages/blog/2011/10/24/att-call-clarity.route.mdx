You can say am trying to justify my decision to stick with AT&T or whatever, but I have noticed something interesting. When I am connected to AT&T 3G and the other party is as well, there is a definite improvement in call clarity. If one or both parties are on 2G GSM the call quality is okay, but not as good as 3G.

However, when I am talking to someone on Verizon, the call sounds muddy. I notice I have to ask someone to repeat themselves more often if they are on Verizon. Now it’s possible it is the other user’s phone but I have noticed this consistently with those I know to be on Verizon.

It’s nice that AT&T has something going for it, it’s the only thing I can think of at the moment.
