> Like many modern geeks, we don’t have cable TV service. Our TV set is merely a monitor for game consoles and media players. We can watch movies and TV shows, but not live — only via iTunes and Netflix. It’s more limited than cable TV: relatively few shows are available, and we’re usually pretty far “behind” the broadcast schedule for current shows, making it difficult to talk to people about current TV shows. (This may be a feature, not a bug.) And it requires effort: when a TV episode or movie ends, nothing happens. It’s up to us to decide what to do next and make it happen: either find something else to watch, or turn off the TV and do something else.

This is [what I’m talking about](http://appleuserpro.com/site/what-streaming). This is very similar to the way I operate, and as it becomes easier… less geekier, I believe this sort of thing will be the future more and more.

> But there’s seemingly no way around cable TV operators. They have effectively infinite money coming in (consider how many U.S. households are paying them $60 or more per month), they fight very hard to keep it that way, and they’ve locked up more content deals than any internet video service could hope for.

The Television industry really is a very sick industry right now (and I’m not even talking about moral standards, I’m talking about who controls the industry, where the money is at, how people get their content etc.). I believe that the current model is unsustainable and the content owners, networks, studios etc. would do well to embrace change, to figure out new models before they become completely obsolete and the market moves past them. But we all know that’s never going to happen so it’s going to be a difficult, bumpy, and painful ride for a while.

I do recommend that you read Marco’s whole article.
