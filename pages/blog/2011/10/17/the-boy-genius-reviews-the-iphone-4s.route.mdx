> Apple’s iPhones have not ever been excellent phones for voice calling. Blame the networks, blame the radios or blame whatever else you want — voice calls were almost never a good experience. I’m extremely happy that the iPhone 4S finally starts to break that mold.

> In terms of radio performance, speed and call quality, I am incredibly impressed. I have more service in more places, fewer dropped calls (just about on par with a phone like a BlackBerry 9700, which runs very well on AT&T’s network) and better call quality. The reason for the change? Well, Apple’s new antenna system is surely a part of it as is the updated software on the device, but I think we have to give some credit to the Qualcomm radio that Apple has finally migrated to. Qualcomm is known for making class-topping chips, and this is a welcome change.

> Finally, the speakerphone on the iPhone 4S improves on an already solid experience. It’s not only louder than it was on previous models, but it’s clearer as well, offering call and music audio that’s not distorted or choppy. This improvement most likely has to do with Siri in order to ensure the experience with Apple’s new personal assistant is top-notch and crystal clear, but the improvements trickle down into other areas of the device as well.

I don’t know how it compares to the 4, but compared the my 3GS, iPhone 4S call clarity is **amazing**. I have also noticed **very much improved** RF performance. I can get signal in places I certainly couldn’t before. I also cannot affect the signal by any way I hold the phone. Even on my 3GS, I certainly could make the signal degrade depending on how I held the phone. Apple does indeed seem to be the first company to solve the antenna attenuation problem.

Also, acquiring signal after coming out of airplane mode, or powering on the phone is **much** faster than previous models.

And yes, the speaker phone is actually usable in all environments I have used it in thus far. I was always less than impressed with previous iPhone spearkphone performance.
