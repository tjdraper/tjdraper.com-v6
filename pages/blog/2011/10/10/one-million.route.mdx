> Apple® today announced pre-orders of its iPhone® 4S have topped one million in a single day, surpassing the previous single day pre-order record of 600,000 held by iPhone 4.

And so all the dire predictions about Android overtaking iPhone, yack yack yack, blah blah blah. So much for that. And all the “disappointment” over “no iPhone 5” and all the silly pundits and their dire predictions… Well, apparently Apple hasn’t fallen from grace after all. But y’all people predicting the doom and gloom of iPhone go right on ahead, don’t let the facts stop you.
