Since I’ve been writing about this, I felt it only appropriate to note this and say something about it. While this quick turn around does look bad for Netflix, like they are just flailing about as a fish out of water and don’t know what on the green earth they are doing… still I think it is good of them to admit the mistake and I think ultimately this will help them.

This business however:

> We’re constantly improving our streaming selection. We’ve recently added hundreds of movies from Paramount, Sony, Universal, Fox, Warner Bros., Lionsgate, MGM and Miramax. Plus, in the last couple of weeks alone, we’ve added over 3,500 TV episodes from ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, USA, E!, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, ABC Family, Discovery Channel, TLC, SyFy, A&E, History, and PBS.

Yeah… as [I’ve said before](http://appleuserpro.com/site/what-streaming), they have a LONG way to go, which is what made their whole streaming only thing / spin off the DVD mailings so premature.
