  Engadget: AT&T confirms it's 'working on' a shared data plan, won't commit to a time frame

I would be elated if this happened! As far as I’m concerned I think the model should be to sell data and/or minutes. If I have an account with AT&T and I pay for 2 gigs a month, then I should be able to connect any device I want and use that data. If I run out of data and/or go over, that’s my problem.

I doubt if we will ever actually see that model, but that’s what I would like to see!
