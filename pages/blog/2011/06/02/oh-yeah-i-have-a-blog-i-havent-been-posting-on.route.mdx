I’m trying to get back on the horse so to speak, and try to set aside just a couple minutes a day and post on this blog.

I started Apple User Pro because I have opinions I would like to share for anyone that would care to read them. So I’m going to try again to let the opinions flow!

I have been working on redesigning all three of my sites when I have time, but that time has been hard to come by!
