[How Apple could fix Final Cut Pro X, in 187 words](http://www.technovia.co.uk/2011/06/how-apple-could-fix-final-cut-pro-x-in-187-words.html)

> “Dear Final Cut Pro customers, As you know, we’ve just released Final Cut Pro X. We’re really proud of it. It represents the future of what’s become the most important piece of software for professional video. There are features in it — like the magnetic timeline — that we think you’ll love, and that will help you work faster open up new creative possibilities. However, in rebuilding Final Cut Pro as a 64-bit application from the ground up, we’ve had some tough decisions to make. That means some of the features you’ve grown to love aren’t there yet. Final Cut Pro X is the future of video editing, and we recommend you upgrade to it as soon as possible. But if the feature you need isn’t there, we’d like you to know that we’re working hard to add in the key tools our professional customers know and love, and meanwhile we’re going to continue selling and supporting Final Cut Pro 7 until at least the end of 2012. Best wishes, Apple.”

I actually agree with this. It’s hard for me to give an objective opinion having not been able to use FCP X yet, however, I’ve been fairly lenient in my thinking toward Apple. And I have stated that this feels a lot like the transition from OS 9 to OS X. And there were a lot of haters then too.

But the problem here is fairly obvious, with every move Apple has made in this Final Cut Pro X release they have gone out of their way (it seems like anyway) to let us, the current user base know that they don’t give half a care about the lot of us. In short, they’ve ticked a lot of people off. You cannot purchase Final Cut Studio 3 (with Final Cut Pro 7) anymore. Apple has pulled it from all retail outlets. And frankly it’s premature. Final Cut Pro X is simply not completely ready for the big time. It’s completely missing some features and work flows that a lot of professionals need.

Apple could have completely avoided this situation, and still could actually, by providing a license of Final Cut Studio 3 to every Final Cut Pro X owner. Obviously they would be working toward making Final Cut Pro X better, and getting users to switch over to FCP X as it gains the features specific users need.

I thought [THIS](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/06/27/mellicker-fcpx) was a pretty good take on this idea.

Now, make no mistake, I think Final Cut Pro X is the future of Final Cut, and I think one day we will love it, just like we now love OS X so much more than OS 9. But the problem is Apple is handling this transition VERY poorly. I mean, they handled the transition from OS 9 to OS X extremely well, but it’s like they forgot how to do that. I hope Apple realizes their mistake soon because I want to see Final Cut Pro X succeed very much.
