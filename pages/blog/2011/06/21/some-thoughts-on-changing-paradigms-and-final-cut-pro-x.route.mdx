Apple released Final Cut Pro X this morning…

I’m still collecting my thoughts, reading reviews, watching demo videos, and trying to assess just how much my world is going to be changing and what skills I am going to have to “re-learn” with Final Cut Pro X. It is certainly a radical departure from the Final Cut Pro 1-7 series. I like [this quote](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=12804689&postcount=23) from the MacRumors Forums:

> I don’t know how many people remember OS X 10.0 or 10.1, but it was initially a major step down from OS 9 in a lot of ways. It wasn’t until 10.2 that it really started to feel like a complete OS. This is as radical a change to Final Cut. It’s a clean break, and there’s going to be some pain for awhile - but it is the future.

Exactly right. And this is the way Apple operates. The OS X example is a classic and prime example. Anyone who wasn’t blinded by stupidity could see the potential in OS X, and certainly look where it is now – OS 9 would never have gotten the Mac platform here – but there were definite growing pains.

There are other examples we can point to as well. Though the iPhone wasn’t replacing anything, or a re-build of an existing product, it can still be used as a model here. The original iPhone was great, had lots of potential, but a lot of things that could be added. Apple has chipped away at the feature list, and delivered. iPhone is so much more than it was in the original release. Expect this to happen to Final Cut Pro X as well. The development team for Final Cut is even now I’m sure, working on that feature list of stuff that we are missing. Final Cut Pro X is really a 1.0 release more than a 10.0 release, just as OS X 10.0 was.

Make no mistake, while I may grumble a little (and may even do so in forthcoming posts if I have time to write), I think Apple is essentially on the right track with Final Cut Pro X.
