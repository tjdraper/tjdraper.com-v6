> Why can we still not print from Smartphones and Tablets?

So I’m wondering, what is the iPhone then? Last I checked it was a smartphone, and I can and do print wirelessly from mine…

I’ve been accused of being biased and all, but seriously, who’s biased here? I can print from my Apple smartphone, and the article above doesn’t even mention the iPhone, while lamenting the fact that smartphones can’t print.
