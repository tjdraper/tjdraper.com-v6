There actually is a good point to be made here. While I very rarely see Tiger (10.4) in operation in my various visits and travels to other Mac users, I do still see Leopard (10.5) in use quite a bit more than one would expect. So I think this “all or nothing” approach to selling Lion only through the App Store, which hasn’t even been out for a year, and which was only added on to Snow Leopard via software update, might be a bit extreme and potentially risk leaving some already hesitant to upgrade in the dust running older, unsupported operating systems.

In my opinion the way to handle this is to provide a way to pay for and download Lion through a webpage for those users not yet running Snow Leopard. It doesn’t seem to me like it would be that hard to do.

I suppose we will see if anything like this comes about…
