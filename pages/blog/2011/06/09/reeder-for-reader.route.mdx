[Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) is a an RSS application that syncs with [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader), and it is available for iPhone, iPad, and now OS X ([via the Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id439845554?mt=12)). I bought the iPhone app some time ago because I was simply blown away by it. I have one minor little quibble with it, namely that when turning into landscape mode, it hides the iPhone status bar, making it impossible to quickly scroll back to the top of a long article by tapping…

But this article is more about the release of Reeder for Mac. I have been using the betas of Reeder for Mac for quite some time now (I actually discovered the Mac beta before I discovered the iPhone app). In fact it has become quite essential to my RSS reading. Even in beta, the app felt very polished in a lot of ways (though for most of the beta period, subscription management was not available, and had to be done through Google Reader’s web interface, but even so quite a joy to use).

You can read my original review of the beta [here](http://appleuserpro.com/home/reeder-a-review).

All of it is still valid except for the one bug I mentioned (application hanging occasionally), which was squashed a couple betas ago. Reeder is a great app and the $10.00 fee is well worth it!
