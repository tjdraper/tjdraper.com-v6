Count me among those calling this a way to monetize piracy. The fact is, it’s unlikely that music piracy will ever stop. EVER! iTunes Match charges a yearly subscription, and matches any tracks in your iTunes library, making them available to download through iCloud to any of your devices. This looks like both a great service to the user, and a way to recoup some money from music piracy if the iTunes library in question has pirated music in it.

However…

I’m also going to go out on a limb here and say that iTunes Match works by leveraging track metadata (just like downloading cover art does). I am the only person I know who is meticulous about metadata on music I have imported from a CD or anywhere else. I like my iTunes library to organize properly, and have all the appropriate metadata, album art, etc. But I’m going to go even further out on the limb and say that I doubt whether most music pirates are meticulous about metadata as they add songs to their collection (anyone ever seen an unorganized, metadata lacking iTunes library? Track 01, Track 02, Untitled Album 1, Untitled Album 2 etc. etc.). So if iTunes Match does indeed work off of metadata (and I don’t know how else it would work), it may require a music pirate to go through and add the proper metadata to all those tracks, which could be tedious. So maybe it wouldn’t be all that bad. Who really knows?

But in any event, I think it’s brilliant. I don’t yet know whether I will use iTunes Match, it does require me to pay money. On the other hand, I won’t have my yearly MobileMe subscription anymore, so I could funnel that part of my budget over to iTunes Match and still be money ahead…
