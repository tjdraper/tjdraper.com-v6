title: Windows 8 - going where no OS has gone before (except previous versions of Windows)

I’ll have to admit, even though I only watched about half of the Window 8 demo, I was mildly impressed. Microsoft is actually rethinking their product. Sure they’ve talked about it, sure they’ve had the minwin project going on to try to and detangle the spaghetti code of a kernel that they have/had in the Windows NT base (I don’t know a lot about kernel architecture, but from what I’ve heard and read, even still in Windows 7, the NT kernel makes lots of calls up the software stack, making it dependent on the higher level systems, making Windows one big gargantuan mess! this seems really stupid to me, minwin is/was about fixing that), but now they are actually doing something tangible to the user (and I don’t mean all the eye candy they’ve added starting with Vista and continuing in Windows 7).

Still, when I say that I was mildly impressed, that does not mean I think it’s going to really be any good. I must qualify my level of “impressedness.” What I mean is I’m impressed for Microsoft. I did not expect anything this good to ever come out of Microsoft again. But I still think that Microsoft is not getting the big picture. While we all sometimes have our complaints with the way Apple does things (yes even me, and I did say \*sometimes\*), they get the big picture. They understand that legacy support has a place, and they usually know when to move on past legacy support. While every once in a while I feel they drop legacy support a bit too fast, most of the time they hit the nail squarely on the head. They don’t shackle themselves with baggage. Look at the way they handled the transition from OS 9 to OS X. OS X really wasn’t “10.0” it was “1.0.” Well, I suppose you could count the versions of NeXT that came before but the point is OS X has no relation, no legacy code, no affiliation with classic Mac OS at all. Apple continued to support OS 9 for several years alongside of OS X for those that needed legacy support. You could even emulate OS 9 directly within the OS X environment. Apple started cutting back support until they dropped it in 10.4 (Intel Version). They played the transition really well.

And while it’s different this time, and it will be a much longer transition, they are doing it again with iOS. I believe iOS is the future, even though I think we will see several more revisions of OS X, maybe we will see OS X or some full fledged desktop OS indefinitely for those of us that need the professional features, or maybe Apple will solve the problem in iOS somehow, I don’t know for sure. But I do know that iOS is the future for the vast majority of Apple’s computing needs.

The point here is that Microsoft has the opportunity to do this exact same thing. They have a pretty good Windows product with Windows 7 (I mean, it’s better than any Windows we’ve seen at this point). They could support it alongside an entirely new, more modern operating system for a few years to make the transition. But despite what Microsoft is telling us, if you look closely, they are still including all the Windows legacy support in Windows 8.

I will link to four articles.  Two of which I pretty much agree with, two of which make interesting reads, but which I don’t completely agree with.

The agreement articles:

[Daring Fireball - Why Windows 8 Is Fundamentally Flawed as a Response to the iPad](http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_flawed)

(and even though it’s satirical, it’s fun, the Macalope is always fun! And as usual, in the midst of the satire, he makes great points.)

[The Macalope Weekly: C:\\NGRTLNS.W8](http://www.macworld.com/article/160293/2011/06/cngrtlns_w8.html)

Of course the Lodsys stuff is worth reading too, but the Windows 8 analysis is below that. Here’s an excerpt that I like:

> If you want a ride to the future, there are two ways to get there. One is to catch a ride in the race car Apple’s driving and accept the fact that, for the pleasure of a nice ride, you’re going to have to pay the tolls along the road. Otherwise, you can catch the Microsoft bus. They don’t make you pay the tolls but the bus stops everywhere.

And two articles that I don’t necessarily agree with every point, but that are enjoyable for geek reading:
