So perhaps it is a bit vain of me, and maybe no one will even notice or care since I don’t post on here very often. I really don’t know that anyone is paying attention to my sporadically updated site…

But I have been working on a site redesign in my “spare” time. This redesign will simplify the design (one of my design tendencies lately) and will unify all three of my current sites that I operate. I have finished the Photoshop template and am in the midst of turning that into HTML and CSS. From there it will be parsed into Expression Engine templates.

Unfortunately it will be a while before the design is actually implemented because I’m busy working on paying projects at the moment. Speaking of which, I must now go and do just that. Below is a full screenshot of the new design.

(And I do intend to start posting more often)
