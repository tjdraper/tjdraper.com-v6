Sorry for the downtime last night and the weirdness with the RSS feed. I performed some upgrades to Expression Engine but didnâ€™t realize my Multiple Site Manager was not functioning properly after the upgrade. This caused AppleUserPro to go down and the RSS feed to pull in posts from my other site TJDraper.com.

I have now corrected the issues.
