All in all a great write up on what is and isn’t going on with FCP X. A lot of the stuff I’ve been seeing around the web seems like knee jerk reactions to the entirely new paradigm and interface of FCP X. No one (save the few whom Apple gave early access) has had enough time to learn how to use FCP X and formulate an appropriate opinion. Those who have had early access all pretty much say the same thing – some things are missing, but give it a chance.

Here’s a quote that is possibly my favorite from the linked article:

> **Is Final Cut Pro X really for the “Pros”?** I’ve already wondered What the heck is a “pro” anyway?, so I think it’s more useful to consider professional workflows instead of “pros”. From the answers above you should be able to see that at version 1 Final Cut Pro X won’t support some professional workflows, but for other professional workflows it will be more than capable. Using Final Cut Pro X to cut together a story, I’m struck by how fast it is to achieve a result, as if everything was designed to get a result a quickly as possible.
