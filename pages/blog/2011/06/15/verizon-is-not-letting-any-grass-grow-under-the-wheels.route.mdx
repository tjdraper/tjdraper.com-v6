Does anyone remember how long it took AT&T to get this much 3G coverage? They were in much the same boat then as Verizon is in now – deploying an entirely new network. And a lot of people said it would take Verizon just as long to deploy their 4G as it took/is taking AT&T to deploy 3G. Well from where I’m standing Verizon appears to be moving like a freight train!

Verizon is looking like a mighty good choice when I get around to upgrading my phone… Which will probably be next year.
