Yes, I know Apple announced 3 things this past Monday, OS X Lion, iOS 5, and iCloud. But I’m going to concentrate on iOS 5 for the most part since it’s the most exciting to me, and only briefly mention Lion (and maybe iCloud).

And so here’s my brief comments about Lion. Yeah, I am excited about Lion (and to some extent iCloud in that it will be free and provide me with all the key features I’ve been paying for with MobileMe). Mission Control looks wonderful, and Spaces looks like it will actually be usable in Lion (I can’t stand spaces in Leopard/Snow Leopard). Full screen apps, if done right (and things are looking good in that regard) could be a great thing, as well as resume and autosave. Oh, and I might actually start using Mail.app again in Lion… I have been using a wonderful email client called [Sparrow](http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/) of late, but we’ll have to see, Sparrow really is a wonderful email client.

And now on to the star of WWDC 2011 (as far as I’m concerned), iOS 5.

As usual, Apple [has a good, and nice looking web page](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html) detailing the new features demoed at WWDC. Well lets just say this looks to be as big an upgrade as iOS 4 was, and iOS 4 was a pretty big upgrade (I didn’t have AppleUserPro at that time and wrote my thoughts on my personal blog [before](http://tjdraper.com/home/render/what-apple-must-do-to-keep-me/) the event, and [after](http://tjdraper.com/home/render/my-opinion-how-did-apple-do/)).

So what’s there to be excited about in iOS 5?

**1\. Notifications** One of the things I was disappointed we didn’t get in iOS 4 was better notifications (and I lamented such in the “after” article linked above). Indeed, I remember feeling even back when iOS 3 came out that Apple was quite late to the party of better notification management. Sure, Apple’s mode of operation often seems to be, not first to market, but best to market. Certainly, Cut/Copy/Paste is an example of this. But with Cut/Copy/Paste it didn’t feel like Apple had been dragging their feet. Apple brought it to us in what seemed a fairly timely fashion, not first, but certainly best. iOS was young and fresh and so much needed to be worked out that it all seemed reasonable.

But there notifications were, passed by in iOS 3 (née iPhone OS 3), and then again in iOS 4. And even among the Apple faithful there was quite a murmur. How could something this important, and seemingly simple enough to understand (for crying out loud just give us a place where these notifications are collected already) be passed over this long?

And so it is with both exasperation on the one hand (what on the wide, green earth took so long?), and absolute delight on the other hand that I watched (or rather read on the live blogs of the event) Scott Forstall unveil [Notification Center](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#notification). Definitely not first to market, and not even a new approach (_cough_ Android _cough_), but definitely well done and well polished (as far as I can tell without having used it yet).

So goodbye and good riddance modal popups, and hello beautiful, easy to manage notifications.

Also, Notification Center has Widgets!

**2\. iMessage** I must confess that while this looks to be quite awesome, one thing that seems to be missing (or perhaps just not yet unveiled) is an iMessage counterpart for OS X. Personally, I’d be happy to see it integrated into iChat. We shall see. It does look great.

**3\. Newsstand** Yeah… maybe I’m missing something, but as far as I can tell, I couldn’t care less. I subscribe to RSS feeds (and lots of them) not newspapers and magazines. Yeah, I just don’t care.

**4\. Reminders** This is another one of those, “What on earth Apple?” things. It has always been strange to me that iPhone syncs with iCal, either via cable, or via MobileMe, and iCal has ToDos while iPhone does not. ToDos in iCal are part of the calendar, are synced to MobileMe. So why were they not a part of iPhone? I finally spent money on a good ToDo app that syncs wirelessly with MobileMe via CalDav and will therefore sync with ToDos in iCal.

But, I am excited to have ToDos come natively to iOS, and about time!

And location based reminders with a geofence, absolutely brilliant (i.e. remind me to go by the store for my wife when I leave work).

**4\. Twitter Integration** I’ll probably use it, but it’s not a super exciting feature to me.

**5\. Camera** I have certainly found in the past that by the time I get my phone unlocked, get to the right home page and launch the camera app, the moment I was trying to capture is gone.

Therefore, being able to double click the home button, then tap the camera button to launch camera and snap a picture quickly without having to unlock the phone should be great for me.

Also, using Volume Up as a shutter button should be great, I should be able to hold it like a real camera. I didn’t think they would ever actually do it though. It’s kinda weird. Up to this point the simplicity of having one function assigned to a specific button has never been questioned. Volume button always changes volume… well, convention has been broken now. But I’m happy about it.

**6\. Photo Enhancements** Meh

**7\. Safari** First of all, Apple is bringing “Reading List” to Safari that syncs across all your devices that have Safari. This is great news to me. I’ve been using Marco Arment’s [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com). And I do like Instapaper on the one hand. But it doesn’t feel integrated very well. Reading list will be integrated and managed from right within Safari. So, much as I feel bad for Marco, I will probably switch.

Safari is also going to include tabbed browsing, but I have been unable to divine whether that will be true on iPhone as well, or just iPad. It makes sense on iPad, plenty of screen real-estate for it, and having to tap twice to switch pages when tabs let you click just once makes sense. I’m not sure I would like tabs on my small screen iPhone.

Also, the reader feature looks interesting, but I don’t know how much I’ll actually use it.

**8\. PC Free** This is a natural progression. You no longer need to sync and activate with iTunes to start using iOS. Just enter your Apple ID and password and go. Doubtless most users will plug in to iTunes at some point. But as more and more stuff moves to iCloud it will become less and less necessary. This is a good move on Apple’s part.

**Other** There’s also a lot of other smaller enhancements, the biggest of which deserves a mention, which is Mail. We will now have rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline, indenting etc.), Flagging of messages, dragging of addresses from field to field.

Overall, iOS 5 will make me and most every other iOS user a very happy camper. While it has taken Apple a little while on some of these features (and there’s no excuse I can make for them on some of these things anymore), this really just propels iOS that much farther ahead of the competition. You see in my estimation iOS, despite it’s notification issues, and other flaws, has remained a superior mobile operating system. Now, with feature parity on all the major issues (that I can think of), it leaves the competition in the dust.
