The ITU [recently redefined 4G to include HSPA+](http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/18/itu-reverses-its-decision-lte-wimax-and-hspa-are-now-4g/) and AT&T is now on that bandwagon! (despite the fact that [they weren’t happy with T-Mobile for jumping the gun](http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=6914)). I’m sure it makes AT&T pretty happy since they have been in the processing of upgrading their (pitifully small) HSPA footprint to HSPA+. Suddenly, that footprint can now be called 4G.

However, I do have a little bone to pick with AT&T. [CTO John Donovan blogs](http://www.attinnovationspace.com/2010/12/01/more-than-one-acronym-for-speed/):

> In their haste to build LTE networks, some wireless service providers are stinging from their decision not to update their current networks. They have just one way to spell “speed,” and it’s “LTE.”

To be clear, “some wireless service providers” would be Verizon. Now, it’s not really fair for him to put it like that. It’s what we normal folks like to call “spin.” The fact of the matter is, Verizon’s chosen technology, which gave them an edge over AT&T in the beginning is now at end of life. Verizon isn’t stinging from not updating their current network, they are stinging from the fact that their current technology has been pushed as far as it can go. This is exactly the reason why they are making haste to build their LTE network. Their CDMA network can’t be upgraded to 4G speeds like AT&T’s HSPA can.

Slight departure from the point I want to make here, but I must comment on this:

> We know about speed. We have the nation’s fastest mobile broadband network. Our largest competitor’s non-LTE wireless network is 60 percent slower on average nationally.

Then how come (in my area at least), Verizon’s end of life technology gets faster data speeds than AT&T’s 3G network? HSPA has so much potential and I have yet to see AT&T really tap that potential.

Anyway, moving on to the point I really want to make here:

> Customers of carriers who chose not to upgrade their current networks will move in and out of LTE coverage areas as well. But as they do, they’ll experience a jarring speed degradation. If they’re online and on the phone when they move to sites that don’t support simultaneous voice and data connections, they’ll drop one of those connections.

Oh my, where to start? I mean, that’s not familiar to me at all… as a customer of yours AT&T… I mean I _never_ drop from 3G to EDGE on your network AT&T _cough_ In the middle of solid blue 3G _cough_

I mean seriously, does AT&T really want to go there? The fact of the matter is that Verizon provides a pretty nice experience with their technically inferior CDMA network (because Verizon actually knows how to engineer a network). Falling back from LTE to CDMA on Verizon can’t be nearly as jarring as falling back on EDGE from AT&T’s current 3G/4G.

> More than half of our customers use simultaneous voice and data regularly. Three in four told us that a consistently good speed experience is very important to them.

And yet I’d totally give up simultaneous voice and data if I could have a more stable network! But maybe that’s just me.

> As carriers’ LTE footprints expand in coming years, the speed of today’s networks can’t be ignored because they’ll play a big part in delivering the mobile Internet well into the future.

Yeah, but see, the problem with that statement is Verizon plans to have their entire 3G footprint covered with LTE by 2013.

Here is the bottom line. AT&T, despite completely blowing it up to this point on their 3G deployment, is actually very well positioned. Their current 3G footprint is capable of delivering 4G speed, and can now be called 4G according to the standards body that governs these things. All they need to do is simply _DO IT_ and they will instantly have a larger 4G footprint than Verizon. Will they? History tells me no. But, there are indications that AT&T may be waking up, so we will see.
