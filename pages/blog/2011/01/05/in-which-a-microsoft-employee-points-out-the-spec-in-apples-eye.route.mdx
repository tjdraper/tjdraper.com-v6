> Sinofsky recalled sitting on a plane next to a passenger who used a succession of Apple devices during and after the flight. First the passenger texted and talked on his iPhone before takeoff, then watched a movie on his iPad, listened to music on his iPod, and finally opened up his MacBook upon landing to catch up on everything he missed while in the air. “That’s not particularly converged,” Sinofsky said during an invitation-only press conference Wednesday afternoon, hours before Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was scheduled to give his Consumer Electronics Show keynote. “In fact, it was clear some of the same scenarios were happening across devices.”

Yeah, because Microsoft is so good at integrating and converging stuff. Wait, how many versions of Windows 7 are there again? I know it’s less than Vista, but still more than OS X.

And from the comment section of the 9to5mac article:

> This coming from a company that has Windows 7 Home, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home but kinda Work, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Professional with Pepperoni, and of course Windows 7 Ultimate which is the main product they should be shipping to all computers anyway.
