I was wrong, I admit it. I [said Apple wouldn’t make a CDMA iPhone](/blog/2010/09/23/a-verizon-iphone-not-so-fast). I also [said they wouldn’t release a CDMA iPhone 4 six months before releasing iPhone 5](/blog/2010/10/08/the-new-york-times-jumps-on-the-rumor-mill).

[And yet…](http://www.apple.com/iphone/notify-me/?sr=hotnews.rss)

I’m a big boy, I can admit it.

I was wrong alright. Move on.

Why are we still talking about this.

Ahem, well anyway… I will say I’m very happy about this development. Even if [AT&T is shouting about Verizon 3G being so pokey](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/10/att_says_verizon_iphone_users_will_experience_life_in_the_slow_lane.html) (news flash AT&T, EVDO is faster than EDGE so shut up already would ya?). I’m very happy indeed. I imagine switching back to the dream carrier shortly after my AT&T contract expires!

TiPb has [a post over here](http://www.tipb.com/2011/01/12/verizon-att/) on whether you should switch or not. But I’ve a bone to pick (and don’t get me wrong, I usually like TiPb).

Near the end of the article, they pick up AT&T’s talking point about simultaneous voice and data.

> AT&T’s GSM network allows for simultaneous voice and data. This means that you can do things like browse the web, check email, and stalk Facebook while talking on the phone. Verizon’s CDMA network is not capable of doing this.

Okay, two problems related to each other. First and foremost, GSM **does not** do simultaneous voice and data, UMTS does. UMTS is based upon, and an evolution of the GSM standard. But GSM is a 2G network technology and does not do simultaneous voice and data. Most of AT&T’s physical footprint is still GSM 2G, with UMTS in the major metro areas, and a few rural areas. Which brings me to my second problem with the statement above. GSM 2G being incapable of doing simultaneous voice and data, it is incorrect to make a blanket statement that if I’m on AT&T I’ll be able to do the simultaneous thing. I most certainly cannot here where I live since I’m **still** on 2G EDGE data/GSM voice. So if I switched to Verizon, I wouldn’t be in any different situation as far as data and voice simultaneously goes, but I’d have significantly faster data since Big Red has 3G here where I live (they even have 4G here).

But the article goes on:

> Also, AT&T boasts of faster speeds than Verizon.

Yes, AT&T certainly does boast that. Yep, that’s what they boast…

Oh, TiPb, are you implying that it’s true? Of course they are. And it is true… in a very few places. But why don’t you go look at my wonderful 3G speeds in Nashville recorded earlier today:

I mean, how pathetic is that? So laying aside for a moment that Verizon’s EVDO is leagues ahead of the EDGE data in my home area, there’s the fact that most places I go with 3G are never as fast as Verizon’s EVDO.

Also, one more thing about simultaneous voice and data. I really couldn’t possibly care any less about that “feature.” As I [said in this post](/blog/2010/10/08/blah-blah-voice-and-data-simultaneously-blah-blah), “I find it very hard to surf the web **when my phone is up to my ear!**” (Also, notice how I make some of the same points in that post of mine I just linked to? Guess TiPb doesn’t read this blog… ha!)
