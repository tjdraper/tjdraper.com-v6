Still rumor in my opinion but hard to deny the evidence. Everyone is claiming it’s a done deal. Specifically, The Wall Street Journal [is claiming with certainty:](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704739504576068170230339348.html)

> The iPhone is finally coming to Verizon Wireless.
> 
> The largest U.S. wireless carrier will make the long-awaited announcement at an event Tuesday in New York City, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

I have said previously that I didn’t think Verizon would get the iPhone until they had rolled out LTE network wide. And I think that Apple thought that too. However, I think the success of Android is pushing them. So Apple had to do something.

Now it is interesting that this event is being hosted by Verizon in New York, and not Apple in California. My first reaction was to say to myself, “See, they aren’t announcing any iPhone, Steve would keep that to himself.” But Gruber [set my thinking straight](http://daringfireball.net/2011/01/verizon_event) and it makes sense:

> So why is next Tuesday’s announcement of the Verizon iPhone a Verizon-hosted event in New York and not an Apple-hosted event in Cupertino? Here’s my theory. Apple is fully aware that when they say “We’re having an event next week” that people expect big news and a new product. If they were hosting this event, speculation would be rampant that it would involve a new iPad and maybe an iPhone 5, in addition to the expected Verizon deal. There is no new Apple product, though. We nerds know that a CDMA iPhone 4 is a different device than the GSM iPhone 4, but from a consumer perspective, it’s the same phone but just works on a different carrier. What would Apple show? What would there be to demo?

We’ll see for sure on Tuesday.

If it happens, I will be thrilled, but I’m planning on staying with AT&T till my contract runs out for sure.
