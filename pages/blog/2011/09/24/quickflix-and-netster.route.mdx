So I feel like I should say something about the whole Netflix / Quickster fiasco. Oh, you’ve been living under a rock and don’t know anything about it? Oh. Well, here, read this:

[An Explanation and Some Reflections](http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html)

The gist of this is that Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix) is sorry for the pricing change fiasco, and so here’s more bad news to set things right… we’re spinning off the DVD mailing business and going streaming only. The whole thing kinda left me scratching my head actually. Why is this a good thing?

While I don’t blame Netfilx for this problem, I blame the stupid content owning companies and studios, the streaming selection on Netflix is abysmal. Having been a Netflix subscriber for years, I can tell you that way over half of anything I ever wanted to watch was not available for streaming. Streaming was always a nice supplement, and in a lot of ways became a staple for us. But on the other hand, we wouldn’t have been able to use Netflix without the great DVD library. To me the services were complimentary. You can get practically any DVD in the world through Netflix, but Streaming is pretty limited. And it seems to be ever changing as streaming deals with studios and content owners expire etc. So the idea to spin off the DVD side and have Netflix be streaming only seems like a death sentence in a world where the content owners are stupid if you ask me. You better believe that the studios are going to choke down very tightly on Netflix.

Again, I don’t blame Netflix for this problem, I **do** blame them for the way they have conducted themselves in the last couple of months. I would like to say something about how **stupid** all the laws are, and how stupid the MPAA is, and how all this is completely retarded, but I can’t pull my thoughts together right now, and that feels like a different post. Suffice it to say I think Netflix has lost their minds and I have canceled my subscription. It’s such a shame because they were such a great company and they blew it.
