A few more thoughts on Netflix, and streaming in general.

The real problem with Netflix’s plan to spin off the _DVD by mail_ business and go streaming only is the selection of streaming content. Before I canceled my Netflix account (back when they offered streaming if you were a subscriber by default), I would often head over to check out Netflix streaming selections on my Wii, only to find that, 90% of the time, the movie I was interested in was not available for streaming. And I’m talking very recently. It’s not like I’m talking about my experience 2 years ago or something. The streaming rights just aren’t there yet for Netflix, nor may they be for a long time.

The thing is, streaming rights are different from the right to rent out a physical DVD. The [first sale doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine) applies to physical DVDs. It has no bearing on streaming rights. This puts all the power in the hands of the content owners, and they have decided to be dragged into the digital age kicking and screaming and generally making themselves a pain in the rear quarters. Their business model seems to be, “monetize every little bit, milk it for all it’s worth, don’t let up, make everyone hate you.” The problem is, it’s going to come back and bite them sometime in the fairly near future.

But the point is, for now, they are being stupid and there’s nothing we, or Netflix can do about it. With DVDs, I could be assured that if I wanted to watch it, I could get it within a couple days if it wasn’t available for streaming. Now suddenly if I want both, I have to subscribe to both Quickster and Netflix, for quite a bit more money than previously. The communication from Netflix, their general handling of this entire affair in fact, was completely botched. I have decided not to give my money to this company anymore.

So moving on from Netflix, I want to talk a little more about streaming. We are rapidly moving into the “streaming age.” And yet, why is the streaming content selection so abysmal. Why does it take 4 to 6 weeks after my favorite TV show airs for it to show up on Hulu? Why aren’t digital downloads counted in shows ratings? I mean I don’t get it.

As an example, I’m an avid fan of Stargate and I wanted to watch _Stargate Universe_ as it aired, or shortly thereafter on Hulu or Netflix, or anywhere streaming. I don’t have cable, or satellite, or even any way to pull in TV signal from the airwaves of any kind. I watch all my shows and movies digitally in one way or another. But SyFy (I have grown to loathe that channel and it’s policies) decided to delay streaming availability by several weeks. I read complaints in many places about this. SGU’s ratings were never stellar, and continued to drop, I think because ratings were counted only by those who tuned in via conventional means. iTunes downloads, Hulu, etc. were not counted. And yet Stargate, by it’s very nature attracts a tech savvy audience. There were lot’s of people watching via alternate means that at least loved the show enough to keep in on the air (it certainly wasn’t the best Stargate series by any means, but it was really starting to get better when SyFy canceled it).

What I don’t get is that all this streaming can be monetized in the same ways, with commercials and the like, as they are on conventional TV. And to some extent, they often are. Hulu has commercials, though not quite as much as conventional TV. You would think that all the content providers would be looking for ways like this to get more viewers and therefore more monetization of those views. Streaming is the future, and all the studios and content owners are doing by dragging their feet and making things hard for the consumer to consume, is engendering a lot of ill will. It makes no sense to me.

So here’s my deal, the first service to provide a very large majority of the content I’m interested in watching via streaming for a decent subscription price (say $15 to $20 a month), with a way to stream to my iOS devices as well as my TV in some way will have my business. I mean, Netflix would be fine if they offered the content for streaming I am interested in.

That’s what I want, and I can’t imagine that I’m alone in this.
