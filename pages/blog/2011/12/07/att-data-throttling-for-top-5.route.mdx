I still don’t understand how it is possible to use this much data. In order to be in AT&T’s top 5% you have to use a ton of data. I don’t skimp on the data usage and the most I’ve used in one month was 1,400 megs. In a typical month I’m under 1,000 megs.

Also, I think it’s important to point out that AT&T only sends these messages, and then subsequently throttles data speed for those who are on the “unlimited” plans, not on tiered plans. I’m on the 2 gig plan. If I were ever to go over 2 gigs, it would cost $10.00 for each additional gigabyte. There’s no need to throttle my data speed because I would be paying for more data. Even if AT&T’s implementation of tiered pricing is a joke, it’s a far better solution than the “unlimited” plan ever was.
