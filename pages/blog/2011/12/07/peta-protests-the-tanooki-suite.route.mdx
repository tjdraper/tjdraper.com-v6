> We may be excited about Super Mario 3D Land, but there’s one group who certainly isn’t. PETA says that when Mario dons a Tanooki suit in the game, he’s giving the green light to would-be fur wearers.

This is not Apple related per se, but I’m an Apple geek who is into Super Mario, so I’m saying it’s applicable. Trust me, it is…

I don’t like PETA. I freely admit it. And I have no problem with wearing fur. I don’t think that’s at odds with not being cruel to animals. I don’t think you should be cruel to animals.

I have no doubt that there is cruelty to animals in any business that uses animals for any products, that’s because humans tend to be that way… But that doesn’t mean that we can’t or shouldn’t use animals. If I can wax Christian for a moment on this Apple Geekery site… we have been given dominion over the animals. We should not abuse them or be cruel to them, but we have dominion over them and using their fur, eating beef or chicken or any other meat is within that dominion. We should strive to not be cruel or abuse animals certainly. “A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.” Proverbs 12:10. I’d even go so far as to say proper animal cruelty laws are acceptable (not the stupid stuff we have today, but laws against starving your horse to death for instance).

But moving on. Being a Mario geek, I have fond memories of the Tanooki suite from 1988 and on. I got Super Mario 3 shortly after it came out. It was the best game of it’s time. And it’s a silly complaint to gripe against the famous Tanooki suite Mario dons.
