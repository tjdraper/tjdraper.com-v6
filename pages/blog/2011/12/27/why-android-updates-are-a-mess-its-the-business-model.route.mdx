> The Android community is traveling along a path that the old Windows Mobile platform followed a few years ago. It was a disaster then, and Microsoft wisely abandoned that entire business model when it developed Windows Phone 7. Alas, Google doesn’t have that option, which means that Android users are going to continue to face a mess when it comes to updates.

…

> In the U.S. market, carriers don’t want to sell you a new phone. They want you to pay them a monthly bill, preferably a big one with a full data plan and a bunch of add-on services. New phones cost them money, in the form of subsidies they pay the handset maker in exchange for getting you to agree to a two-year contract to pay that big monthly bill. You pay off that subsidy over the life of your contract. When the contract is up, your carrier is perfectly happy if you keep paying the big bill.

Overall a good analysis of what’s wrong with the Android model, at least when it comes to updates. The real problem here is that no one in the Android business is really focused on the end user experience the way Apple is. And this is why Apple customers tend to be more loyal in my opinion. We care about the end user experience, and Apple delivers.
