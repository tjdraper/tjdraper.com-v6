> One file in particular, USBDeviceConfiguration.plist, had formerly listed about two dozen different device variants. As [discovered by 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman,](http://yfrog.com/z/o0230gp) that list has now ballooned to well over 100 such entries as Apple has seeded it with dozens of new fake references to such future products as “iPad10,1”, “iPhone11,3”, “iPod11,1”, and “AppleTV8,3”.

And some say the folks at Apple have no sense of humor…
