I know this doesn’t look anything like the [site design preview I posted some time back](/article/sneak-peak-site-redesign). But I decided to go in a different direction. I like this design a lot, it’s simpler and cleaner than the previous design.

I know I need to update my Colophon page. It’s actually the same page as the “about” page was on the previous design. I’ll get around to it hopefully this week.

Also, I’ve disabled comments and have not even included the code in the new design. Why is that? First, the simple fact is, hardly anyone ever comments here. I’m just not that important. I don’t have that many readers. Getting all the coding, margins, input forms, layout, and everything else set up for comments when I redesign takes almost as long as implementing the rest of the design. It just isn’t worth it to me.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I’ve come a long way in my thinking on this. I used to think comments were essential to a blog or online publication. And I loved to think people were engaged enough to comment on my posts. It was sort of self serving. I’ve come to realize that traditional commenting systems represent everything that is wrong with the web. In fact, I don’t even bother to read comments on any of the sites I visit anymore that actually still use comments. The comments are full of ignorant trolls who want nothing more than to slander the author, or bash the other commenters. I’m not saying that’s true of most people who would comment here, but a while back (probably a couple years ago), I did have to do some comment moderation.

The nature of blog commenting lends itself to unconsidered responses. The commenter can (and often does) post anonymously, meaning there’s little repercussion for them when they are rude and inconsiderate. Many of the best publications I read now do not have comments as part of their site. They either disabled them, or in some cases realized when they were launching their site it was a waste of time and never used them.

I have a comment link up there in the menu. It will open an email composer window for you. If you would like to send me a comment, I would love to hear from you. This method of commenting will cause most people (I think) to at least a little more carefully consider their response. If I like what you say, and you give me permission, I may even post it on my blog. If you really feel strongly about something I say or do here, and you would like to respond publicly, then I encourage you to start your own site and publish something.

So, that’s my thinking in not doing comments here. You may have noticed if you follow my stuff, that I did not do commenting on [Apple User Pro](http://appleuserpro.com).

I hope you all enjoy the new design. I like it, and my wife likes it. Now maybe I’ll post pictures more often.
