Paul Miller over on the verge wrote an article which he entitled “[The condescending UI](http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/9/2616204/the-condescending-ui).”

This prompted my desire to write a little bit about UI design. I have several problems with his analysis so why don’t we dive in.

> My problem with many modern UIs is that they never get past the telling phase. They’re always dressing up their various functions with glows and bevels and curves, and in the process they somehow become overbearing to my senses.

Okay, let me make sure I have this straight Paul, you don’t like it when a UI communicates its functions and what exactly it is that it’s doing?

> Now imagine that car explaining all of these various functions every single time you get in the car for the next five years, until you finally snap and drive it off a cliff.

You mean like a speedometer telling you exactly how fast you’re going? Or a shifter with fixed icons always telling you what gear you’re in? How about a fuel gauge telling you how much fuel you have left, or worse a fuel warning light when you only have about one gallon left?

Seriously, I don’t get it.

> An example of this is the dramatic, quasi-utilitarian animated transition. The first few times, it’s conveying important information: click that button? That launches this action! Swoosh. The next 10,000 times, it’s mainly just slowing me down.

He has an animated gif of the animation OS X uses when you minimize a window. But I fail to see how this slows anyone down. When I minimize a window, by the time I can even start moving my mouse again, the animation is done and the window has disappeared. Not only that, it communicates important information. Where has the window gone to? Well that question is easily answered since the little animation showed you exactly where it was going. Sure, experienced users may indeed know exactly where that window is, but that doesn’t mean the UI shouldn’t communicate it. Should a shifter in a car stop telling you what gear it’s in after a couple weeks?

> But it’s not just functionality, there’s something deeper that bugs me, about the decorations themselves. Like the ubiquitous drop shadow. “Did you know that this window is on top of this window?”

So what should it communicate instead? That this window is under the others? That it has the same focus? That it’s not more important than the other windows? You see, the UI has to communicate somehow that a window has focus and will capture input. I don’t always specifically notice the drop shadow on active windows, but my mind notices because I did an experiment a little while back. I used some terminal commands to disable UI drop shadows (and animations, but that’s another story). After I had done so, I had a much more difficult time determining which Application had focus. The drop shadow communicates something; it has a job to do.

> Apple’s love of reflections and faux 3D subtly imply to me that I might be lost, needing landmarks and a sense of place to find my way.

Because everyone loves to be stuck in a deep dark forest in the middle of the night with no possible way to tell how to get out; no lights, no signs. Nothing… Or to go back to the car analogy, because there shouldn’t be road signs telling me what road I’m on? Or what road is interecting with the one I’m on.

And that brings me to one of my main points. I do have some UI problems here and there with OS X don’t get me wrong, but for the most part, Apple has done a very good job of using animations and great design to communicate aspects of the UI properly to the user. Just because us experienced users know where things are, or what parts of the UI do what does not mean that the UI should cease to communicate these things. Should the “close window” button be a color other than red because we now know what that button does? Of course not, or else it would no longer communicate what it does, and we would not know what it does without trial and error. It becomes less discoverable. UI has to be discoverable. Should, as Paul suggests, a minimized window not show us where it went because we all know that now? I would say not, or else it wouldn’t be discoverable.

> And of course, there is the transgression of the century: Apple’s downward spiral into overt 1:1 metaphors. The physical bookshelf, the leather desk calendar (complete with a torn page), the false-paginated address book, whatever Game Center is trying to pull off.

I do actually agree with Paul about Lion’s Address Book. It’s less functional than Address Book in Snow Leopard. It is one of the very few legitimate gripes against Lion actually. And I have legitimate gripes with iCal in Lion [1](#notcondescendingbutgood-fn1), none of which have to do with the new look. I actually kind of like the leather look of iCal.

> Ultimately, an OS is much more than its chrome, it’s about what it can do, and how efficiently it can do it.

Yes, I agree to a point. But there’s no reason an OS “must” look ugly.

> BeOS is purely digital, with a sort of 8-bit charm, complete with pixel-perfect isometric icons. It’s much like the appeal of “retro” indie games, which deal in our native, shared gaming language and metaphors, not something borrowed from action movies or an overblown sense of virtual reality. But it’s all a fantasy, really: I’ll probably never be able to do even a fraction of my daily work on Haiku. Just like how my SNES will never run Skyrim.

So, what was the point again?

In the end, Paul winds up telling us how he’s switched his Windows 7 computer over to the “Classic Theme” which reminds him of the good old days of Windows 95.

Yeah, those were the days…

And he wishes someone would port the OLD NeXT UI to OS X. Basically, he wants computers to be ugly again.

Meanwhile, I’ll continue to live in the much more beautiful garden of OS X Lion and not for a moment miss the days when computers were ugly and hard to use.

1.  My main problem with iCal 5 is that the calendar list is now a pop-over instead of a sidebar. This means an extra click every time I want to access the calendar list, which is quite frequently for me. It’s really frustrating! [↩](#notcondescendingbutgood-fn1-ref)
