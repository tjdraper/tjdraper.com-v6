> Facebook will never be “private”—indeed, the very idea of making Facebook a more private place borders on the oxymoronic, a bit like expecting modesty at a strip club.

Completely agree. I really, **really** don’t understand all this non-sense over Facebook privacy issues. Facebook privacy is simple to me, if I want to keep something private, I don’t put it on Facebook. End of story. Facebook is a platform for sharing, not for privacy.
