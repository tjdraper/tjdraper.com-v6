> There was a Final Cut 8 and it was 64bit and it was done and they looked at it and said ‘This is not what we want to do, this is evolutionary, this is not revolutionary’ and they killed it.

So I’ve been known to defend Apple on Final Cut Pro X. Sure, it’s missing a few things, but in a few versions we’ll love it. However, if there is any truth to this at all, that Apple had FCP8 running, 64 bit and all, then I’m a little upset. I mean, what was the upside of not releasing it. It was a **long** time between the release of Final Cut Studio 3 (FCP 7), and Final Cut Pro X. Many of us were getting a little worried. I don’t see a downside of releasing Final Cut Pro 8 (presumably bundled as Final Cut Studio 4), and waiting a little bit longer to put some more polish and features on Final Cut Pro X to release it. Also, the FCP user base would not have been nearly as upset about having to wait a bit longer for some rough edges and features to be polished on FCPX if we had a more up to date version of the previous code base of FCP, in the way of version 8.

Alas, what’s done is done. This much I’ve said before and I’ll say it again. Apple seriously screwed up the launch of Final Cut Pro X. That, more than anything, is what hurt Apple on Final Cut.
