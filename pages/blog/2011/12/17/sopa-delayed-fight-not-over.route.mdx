> The House Judiciary Committee considering whether to send the Stop Online Piracy Act to the House floor abruptly adjourned Friday with no new vote date set—a surprise given that the bill looked certain to pass out of committee today.
>
> The committee’s chairman and chief sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), agreed to further explore a controversial provision that lets the Attorney General order changes to core internet infrastructure in order to stop copyright infringement.
>
> Smith said the hearing would resume at the “earliest practical day that Congress is in session.” Hours later, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) tweeted that the committee would resume action Wednesday.

Though this is a surprise, this fight is far from over. But at least there’s an acknowledgment that maybe this needs further investigation. Hopefully someone can knock some sense into these people!
