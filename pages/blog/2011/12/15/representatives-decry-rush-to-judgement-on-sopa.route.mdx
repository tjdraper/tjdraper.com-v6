> The Judiciary Committee gathered on Thursday to consider amendments to SOPA and prepare the bill for consideration by the full House. Several members pointed out that the committee didn’t hear from any technologists at last month’s hearing on the bill. The line-up at that hearing consisted of five bill supporters and a lawyer from Google, which is opposed to the bill. None of the other groups who have expressed concerns—technologists, high-tech investors, legal scholars—have had an opportunity to address the committee.

Yeah, because we wouldn’t want to be exposed to the hard truth of just how bad this legislation is.

> But Watt seemed not to fully understand how either SOPA or Polis’s amendment worked. At one point he asked Polis to clarify whether his amendment would allow universities and non-profits to host infringing content on their websites. Polis pointed out that this wasn’t the amendment’s focus at all. Rather, his amendment was designed to avoid imposing on these organizations the costs of implementing a DNS blacklist, which he described as an unfunded mandate.

Yeah, because who cares what we’re passing, we have to stop copyright infringement at all costs. AT ALL COSTS!
