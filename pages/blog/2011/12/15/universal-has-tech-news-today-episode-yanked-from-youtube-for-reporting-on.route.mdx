> Universal had Monday’s episode of Tech News Today pulled off of YouTube for simply reporting on the controversy.

…

> Tom’s filed YouTube’s corresponding DMCA counter-dispute and the video will go back up in 10 days unless Universal decides to go full-on crazy and actually file a lawsuit, but at this point the damage has been done. As Tom says, “In 10 days a daily news show is worthless, so Universal was able to censor this episode of Tech News Today.”

But I’m sure that the SOPA legislation, which would give companies like Universal far more sweeping powers, will not be abused like this in any way.
