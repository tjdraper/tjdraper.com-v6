I love his rules, I only have minor quibbles with two items.

> **Allow no Flash anywhere**

Unfortunately, while I would love not to have flash anywhere on my site, I do embed the occasional YouTube or Vimeo video and, alas, they do not default to HTML5 for desktop browsers (well, Vimeo does on Safari, but not on IE or even Firefox I believe). But I agree in general, down with Flash!

I disagree with this because you almost have to use a URL shortener for sharing on Twitter and the like and I’d rather have my own custom shortener that always goes to my website instead of one of the common ones that you never know where it’s taking you.

In any event, these rules are great and I can’t wait until someone somewhere starts catching on publications start operating like this.
