For those that believe I think Apple can do no wrong… this is the sort of thing that Apple does that really irritates and annoys me to no end. I don’t always open up the Mac App Store and check for updates, nor do I seem to restart my computer that often, which appear to be the two things that trigger app update badges on the Mac App Store in the dock. Personally, I would like to be notified by applications if there is an update. Sparrow notifying of an update seemed like a good thing to me. It’s not bypassing the Mac App Store, the update still must be obtained through the app store. Frankly, that’s the sort of thing that Appel bans apps for that I **really** disagree with. I understand the need to curate the app store and to actively keep junky apps out, and certainly to keep viruses out and the like. But don’t be stupid. Seriously!
