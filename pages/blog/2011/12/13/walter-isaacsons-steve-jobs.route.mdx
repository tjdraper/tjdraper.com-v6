  Walter Isaacson's 'Steve Jobs'

I have finally finished listening to my audiobook version of the biography _Steve Jobs_ by Walter Isaacson. As I indicated in a previous post, I have some issues with this book.

As a matter of fact, I think Isaacson did a lousy job. I have not read any of Isaacson's other works so I can't say whether this is or is not indicative of his usual type of work.

**Sloppy**

While on some levels I enjoyed the book, I have to say that from my perspective, it seemed very poorly and sloppily written. There were many facts I happened to already know that Mr. Isaacson managed to either get wrong, or badly mangle. It made me question the facts he stated of which I had no knowledge. I do think he probably managed to get the big facts right, it was only little details that he seemed to get wrong. [1](#jobsbio-fn1) And if that were the extent of my problems with the book I probably wouldn't be writing this article; or at least, not in this negative tone. I have numerous other problems with the book.

**Editorializing**

Mr. Isaacson never hesitated to editorialize. Quite heavily. Never hesitated. He would glibly offer his opinion on something someone said instead of letting his readers draw their own conclusions about the things someone was saying.

One thing about the audio book is it makes it hard to pull quotes and I can't find the one I'm looking for with a Google search. But one of myriad examples of the editorializing is when Mr. Isaacson quotes Jobs about Bill Gates having no original ideas and getting rich by ripping other people off. And he adds, "Jobs said **unfairly**." You know what, if you are doing your job as a storyteller, your reader would realize at this point that the comment from Jobs was indeed slightly unfair. But there's no need to add that editorial comment.

In other cases, Isaacson may quote Steve about some particular subject, then add, "and on that matter, Jobs was right." And then he usually moves right on instead of explaining why Jobs was (or wasn't) right.

Towards the end of the book, Isaacson asks Jobs if he believed that his mean spirited-ness (I'm paraphrasing here), was something he couldn't help, if that was just the way he was, or did he choose to be like that? Jobs, after thinking about it for a moment responded that it was just the way he was and he couldn't be someone he was not. Isaacson then offers his opinion that he believed Jobs in fact could help it and chose not to. But why do I care about Isaacson's opinion on this matter? Even before he gave that opinion I had drawn that conclusion myself. I was thinking, "O come on Jobs, of course you can help it. You don't have to be such a hard to get along with human being." But then comes this editorializing and I just want to yank my hair out. The scene was set up perfectly to bring me to that conclusion, indeed the narrative of the book often demonstrated how unreasonable Jobs could be at times, and how that wasn't always an asset. Did we really need the narrative insertion?

And there are many other places in the book where Mr. Isaacson offers his opinion on something that someone said or did and frankly, I just don't care. I'll draw my own conclusions thank you very much. And my conclusion is that Jobs, though often mean spirited, hard to get along with, and generally a pig to the people he worked with, achieved many great things and I don't need the editorial commentary to help me get to that conclusion. There are certainly ways of directing the narrative without beating the reader over the head with an opinion. I'm a film editor who edits lots of documentary films, so I can't help but compare my storytelling experience in that arena. In a documentary, one of the things you strive for is to let your audience draw conclusions for themselves. You let your subjects tell their stories, and often you may have a narrator guiding the story, but you can't beat people over the head with conclusions you have drawn. You have to lead them and guide them there.

**Narrative Impatience**

Mr. Isaacson seems to feel the need to pay things off right away instead of setting things up that can be paid off later in the book as the narrative of Steve's life progresses. The result is a book that feels like a series of sketches in the life of Steve Jobs, rather than a biography [2](#jobsbio-fn2). At times, it feels like whole sentences, even paragraphs, have been copied and pasted from earlier sections of the book, which I'm sure he felt necessary because of the non-linear "sketches in the life" approach, but it leaves you saying to yourself, "Didn't you already tell us this?" In basic structure the book feels like it's trying to be linear; we don't jump from the early days of designing the first Mac to the launch of the iPhone for instance. But in most cases, Mr. Isaacson feels the need to tell complete stories about specific things in Steve's life, following a thread through to completion, then picking up a new one instead of weaving a rich tapestry about the life of Steve, and talking about things in a more linear fashion in which they happened.

**Busting the Mood**

And then finally, I came to the part in the story where Steve resigned as CEO. For all the complaints I had against the book at this point, and all the irritating flaws, this scene was profoundly sad and moving [3](#jobsbio-fn3). Mr. Isaacson had told a tale of a man with a lot of drive; a man who wanted to be at Apple creating new products, working on things, designing things. And he finally had to come to grips with the fact that he was no longer able to be Apple's CEO, nor would he ever be able again. He tells touchingly of how Steve sat in on the board meeting as acting CEO Tim Cook gave a report. Then when Steve said he had something very personal he needed to share, Tim asked Steve if he and other senior members of the executive team should leave the room as he speaks of this matter to the board of directors. Steve paused for over 30 seconds before finally deciding that yes, that would make it easier. He goes on to describe the moving scene with the board of directors, the reading of his resignation letter, the successful smooth handing over of the reigns, some time he spent with Scott Forstall examining some of the new upcoming products.

And then (as Steve might say) BOOM. Mr. Isaacson is off on some yickity yack about Wozniak's model of open computing and Jobs' model of integrated systems. The mood, the tenor was completely broken and Isaacson never managed to recapture the emotion of the closing days of one of the greatest tech CEOs of all time. It was a devastatingly poor way to end a book.

I wish I had been able to take more notes, but often I would listen to the book as I was driving. Maybe someday in the future I'll be able to do a more detailed analysis.

For now, I highly recommend John Siracusa's review on his great podcast [Hypercritical](https://hypercritical.fireside.fm/). The review wound up being two episodes of the podcast, but I can't recommend it highly enough. John knocks it out of the park in his critique.

2.  I am not an expert nor an authority on biographies, but I can't help but feel cheated by the lack of coherence in this book, this is what I'm complaining about. [↩](#jobsbio-fn2-ref)
3.  As a Christian, and knowing what would come in just a couple of short months after this scene. It was all the more sad and moving knowing that for all Steve's earthly accomplishments, he was a pagan and most likely died without Christ. [↩](#jobsbio-fn3-ref)
