> If this were surgery, the patient would have run out screaming a long time ago. But this is like a group of well-intentioned amateurs getting together to perform heart surgery on a patient incapable of moving. “We hear from the motion picture industry that heart surgery is what’s required,” they say cheerily. “We’re not going to cut the good valves, just the bad — neurons, or whatever you call those durn thingies.”

> It’s been a truism for some time that you can tell innovation in an industry has ceased when the industry starts to develop a robust lobbying and litigating presence instead.

> As long as there have been new technologies, the entertainment industry has been trying to get them shut down as filthy, thieving pirates. Video cassettes? Will anyone tune into TV again? MP3 players? Why even bother making a record? Digital video recorder that lets you skip ads? That’s a form of theft!

You are going to continue to hear from me on this issue until you are quite sick of it, but I urge you to contact your representative **right now** and let them know you will not be voting for them again if they support this bill.

My representative is [Marsha Blackburn](http://blackburn.house.gov/) and I have for the most part been happy with her. But she has [publicly](http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_74/marsha_blackburn_conservative_look_at_stop_online_piracy_act-211025-1.html) [announced](https://www.facebook.com/marshablackburn/posts/143950745714561) her support of this liberty eroding legislation, and I will not vote for her every again. If you representative supports this legislation, I urge you to contact them and let them know that this is wrong. And I would urge you to consider not voting for them in the future.
