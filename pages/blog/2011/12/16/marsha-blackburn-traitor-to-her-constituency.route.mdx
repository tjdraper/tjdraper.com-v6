Congresswoman [Marsha Blackburn](http://blackburn.house.gov/) has had my vote up to this point. She’s a fairly conservative representative, and has certainly been the best option until now.

But she has recently supported two pieces of legislation, one of which I consider to be treasonous to our country and a betrayal of the Constitution.

By far the biggest issue, and the one I consider to be treasonous is the National Defense Authorization Act — HR 1540. Section 1031 of this horrible legislation allows for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens, and Section 1032 requires that the detention be by the armed forces in the case of non-citizens. My representative, who I sent to Washington to stand for liberty, has [instead voted for Constitution betraying tyranny](http://www.votesmart.org/bill/14203/37467/25186/national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2012).

The second, an issue admittedly not as high on the priority list, but high enough to alone cost her my vote, is the Stop Online Piracy Act. While this legislation is still being debated in committee (it is all but sure to make it to the house floor with the way things have been going), she has [openly](http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_74/marsha_blackburn_conservative_look_at_stop_online_piracy_act-211025-1.html) sided in [support](https://www.facebook.com/marshablackburn/posts/143950745714561) of this liberty eroding legislation.

I’ve been writing about this legislation over on [Apple User Pro](http://appleuserpro.com/article/category/copyright-garbage). I realize some of you hate my Apple stuff and therefore don’t read my Apple website, but if you [click this link](http://appleuserpro.com/category/copyright-garbage), it will only take you to the category on this topic, which has not so far included anything about Apple directly.

If you are in Marsha Blackburn’s district, I urge you to let her know just how disappointed you are and that you will not be voting for her in the future. If you are not, please look in to which way your representative voted on HR 1540. If they voted for this legislation, I submit to you that they have committed treason against the people of the United States and are not fit to represent you. I urge you to make sure they do not get reelected to continue these crimes against the American people!
