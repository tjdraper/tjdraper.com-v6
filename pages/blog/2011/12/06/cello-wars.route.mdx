A little cheesy perhaps, but I love the music. I’m not John Williams’ biggest fan when it comes to overall scoring, but his themes are usual brilliant. And I think his Star Wars scores are among his best work. Anyway, this rendition/mix of those themes is great. And the cheesy video is funny in places as well.
