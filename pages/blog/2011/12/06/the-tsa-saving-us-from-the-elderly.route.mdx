[Three elderly South Florida women say TSA made them strip](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/fl-tsa-strip-searches-20111205,0,6653714.story)

> Three South Florida women, all elderly and with medical problems, say Transportation Security Administration officers made them take off their clothes during the screening process at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport last week.
> 
> All three, one with a defibrillator, one with a colostomy bag and the other with diabetes, say they were forced to disrobe in a private room at the same terminal.

I’m so glad the TSA put a stop to those potential terrorists. Those elderly people must be the scum of the earth.

You know, words like national security are thrown about a lot, but sometimes the price is just too high. And this is just despicable.
