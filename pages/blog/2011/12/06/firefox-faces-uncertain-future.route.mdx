> It hasn’t been a good year for Firefox. Mozilla has lost share to Google, it’s lost the loyalty of enterprise customers, and it’s lost key talent. And a deal with Google that supplied 84% of its revenue last year was scheduled to end in November. Can Firefox avoid a slide into irrelevance?

I’d say it’s a little late to avoid a slide into irrelevance actually. It’s sort of sad actually, Mozilla started the browser revolution with Firefox. Or at least in my mind they did. Firefox used to be the fit and trim streamlined go-to browser. These days, every time I open Firefox it feels so slow and bloated, and clunky. I far prefer Safari, but if I was forced to use any other browser but Safari it would be Google Chrome, not Firefox. Even though I think Chrome can be pretty clunky and unrefined compared to Safari, it doesn’t feel slow and bloated as Firefox does.

The times, they are a changin’
