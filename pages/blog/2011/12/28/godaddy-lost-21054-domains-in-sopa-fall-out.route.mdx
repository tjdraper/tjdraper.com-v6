This is way back on Friday, Christmas has me a little backlogged.

> It looks like these PR moves to save face, and business, are completely futile. According to TheDomains, 21,054 domains were transferred away from Go Daddy on Friday alone. At $6.99 a pop, that would make for a loss of $147,167, not taking future renewals into account. The day before wasnâ€™t a good one for the company either, with 15,000 people taking their domains elsewhere. That means that even though Go Daddy changed its stance, people have had enough.

This is all just in case we need another reason not to use GoDaddy, which have been stacking up for me anyway.
