> AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) said today that after a thorough review of options it has agreed with Deutsche Telekom AG to end its bid to acquire T-Mobile USA, which began in March of this year.

Anyone who reads my articles knows how I feel about thisâ€¦ I understand why people were opposed to this, I really do. But the question I have is what is T-Mobile supposed to do? They are having a hard time, they want to sell out, no one else is big enough to buy them. And it certainly would have helped AT&T bolster their network.

> To reflect the break-up considerations due Deutsche Telekom, AT&T will recognize a pretax accounting charge of $4 billion in the 4th quarter of 2011. Additionally, AT&T will enter a mutually beneficial roaming agreement with Deutsche Telekom.

The roaming agreement is the only good thing that will come of all this.
