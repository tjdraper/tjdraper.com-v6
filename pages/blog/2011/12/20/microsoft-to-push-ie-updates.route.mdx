> To ensure such nightmares are never relived, the company will start rolling out automatic upgrades to Internet Explorer across Windows 7, Vista and XP, the company announced in a blog post today. Rather than relying on users to update the browser themselves or requiring you to trick your parents into updating theirs around the holidays, Windows will update to the latest compatible version of IE on its own.

This can only be a good thing.

For fun, if you have access to IE6 somewhere (I really hope you don’t), load up this site in IE6 and see how bad it looks. I simply do not have the time to support IE6. I even chose not to pay much attention to IE 7 on this site. You can read in IE7 good enough, but the navigation menu is messed up.

I’m a Safari user, but one of the things I do love about Chrome is that updates are pushed automatically. This means to me as a web designer that I do not have to worry about supporting older versions of Chrome as we move ahead. It’s a wonderful thing!

> The feature will be available to most Windows users, but it can easily be disabled, much to the delight of corporate IT departments everywhere.

Yeah, the one “gotcha” but hopefully we’ll never see the nightmare that is/was IE6 again.
