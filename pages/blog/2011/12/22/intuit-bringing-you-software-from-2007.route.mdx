> As you may know, Quicken for Mac 2007 does not currently work on Apple’s latest operating system, Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion). I understand the frustration this may have caused you and have put a team in place to address this issue. **I am happy to announce that we will have a solution that makes Quicken 2007 for Mac “Lion-compatible” by early spring.**

Yes, this is what we need, Quicken for Mac 2007 — a PowerPC application — shoehorned onto Lion. Are they compiling a custom Rosetta bundle into the application? So what about Quicken 2012?

Frankly, it’s WAY too late to keep me as a customer, or to re-aquire me as a customer. When we realized that Intuit didn’t give half a care about it’s Macintosh users, we switched to software that’s frankly far better than Quicken ever was anyway.

I highly recommend the software we switched to — [iBank by IGG Software](http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/) — to all Macintosh users looking for personal finance management software.
