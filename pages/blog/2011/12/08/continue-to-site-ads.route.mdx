> I didn’t click “Continue to Site,” and I decided not to link to the article.

I have also adopted the stance that I will not click through an add to get to content anymore. It’s getting ridiculous. I understand the need to monetize a site; I have vague plans of someday monetizing Apple User Pro. But for crying out loud, have some taste! Don’t plaster your site with ads, flashing banners and “click to continue” splash screens. Respect your readers.
