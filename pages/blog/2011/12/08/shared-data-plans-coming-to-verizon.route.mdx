> Verizon is gearing up to offer shared data plans sometime in 2012. That’s straight from CEO Lowell McAdam, who told the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference this morning, “I think in 2012 we will see it… Getting to one bill and getting to account-level pricing is our goal.”

This just makes so much sense to me. One pool of data for the account which all devices on my account can draw from. If this [makes Verizon more competitive on pricing](/site/choosing-a-carrier-guess-whos-not-actually-cheaper), I’m there!
