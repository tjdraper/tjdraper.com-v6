> Those new MacBook Pros – the ones released last month – are not only as fast as last year’s Mac Pros, they can also take 16GB of RAM. That puts them a pretty rarified world of computing, at least as far as laptops are concerned.

Wow!

That’s both cool and terrifying. It is cool to know that in a couple years I can upgrade my new MacBook Pro to 16 gigs and make it feel more current. It’s terrifying that it costs $1600.00 right now. But as pointed out in the linked article, that’s what it used to cost for 2 4GB modules.
