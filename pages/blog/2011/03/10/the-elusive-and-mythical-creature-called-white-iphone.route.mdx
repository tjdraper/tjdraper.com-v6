I’m not quite sure what the point is since iPhone 5 is pretty much guaranteed to hit this summer. Except of course they always sell the previous model for a reduced price I suppose, and they could add the white iPhone 4 to the line-up.

I don’t even care, I don’t think I would ever have a white phone… bleh!

Still, Apple seriously messed this one up!
