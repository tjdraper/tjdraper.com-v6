I’ve had a lot going on, but I’ve had a lot I’ve wanted to write about too, and this blog has kept nagging at me as I’ve been busy \*not\* updating it…

I’ve just spent a few hours yesterday working on some changes to the backend that will help me out. Since this is a tech blog I suppose I’ll elaborate.

Up to this point, AppleUserPro has been running on Expression Engine 1.6.3, which was quite out of date. My other site, TJDraper.com was running on the free Expression Engine Core 1.6.7, also out of date, and Ellis Lab doesn’t do Expression Engine Core anymore so I was unable to get any more updates.

Finally, my third site TwoEdgeMedia.com was being driven directly by HTML files on the server. So I shelled out the dough to upgrade my Expression Engine 1 license that I was using for this site to Expression Engine 2 with Multiple Site Manager. I’m now running all three sites from the one Expression Engine Installation. It’s actually quite cool. And as Expression Engine 2 is just cool anyway, it’s double cool.

Anyway, that’s the geek scoop on the technical underpinnings of this site, and my other two sites. I am planning some visual updates soon.

As you can see, I initially went fairly bare bones with this site design. I’ll admit I was being somewhat influences by John Gruber’s Daring Fireball site. But it just isn’t me. I want my site to be a bit more designed so I’m going to work on that. I have no idea how long it will take me. In the mean time, hopefully I’ll get back to posting some more content.
