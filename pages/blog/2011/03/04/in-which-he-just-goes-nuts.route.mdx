I went all out last week…

I bought a brand new MacBook Pro… the day the new models came out.

I had actually been delaying my upgrade, knowing that new models were due any day. And I was not disappointed.

My upgrade cycle goes something like this:

-   Buy the most top of the line new Mac laptop I can get my hands on
  
-   Get as many years out of it as I can, run it until it feels dog slow compared to all the new comptuers (4 to 5 years is preferable)
  
-   Buy the most top of the line new Mac laptop I can get my hands on…

Rinse and repeat, etc.

I didn’t quite make it to 4 years with my previous MacBook Pro. I’ve been known to say that Apple Computers outlast most PC vendor’s computers, and I still believe that’s true. But boy have computers leapt forward. This new MacBook Pro is FAST. I did a video file encode test with HandBrake, same file on both my previous laptop, and the new laptop. On my old laptop (2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo) the file took 1h 40m. On my new laptop (more specs in a minute, but it’s a 2.3 GHz Quad Core i7) it took just 7 minutes. This thing is crazy fast.

I purchased the 17” instead of the 15” as my old Core 2 Duo model was the last of the line to include the Express/34 Cardslot in the 15” version. I have to have the Cardslot (for now) as a video professional. I always considered myself a 15” laptop kind of guy, but I am actually finding that I enjoy the 17” a lot more than I thought I would. The screen real-estate is just phenomenal, and I have yet to be in a situation where I wish it was smaller.

Battery life is also tremendous, aided by the auto switching between the more and less powerful dual graphics cards. It’s not like I’m going to need all the power of the discreet graphics card when I’m not plugged in anyway. When I need that kind of power, I’ll be plugged in. I have gotten as much as 7.5 hours of medium light to medium use.

Speaking of Graphics, both cards have better performance than the one discreet Nvidia card in my old Core 2 Duo. I sure did/do hate that 9600m GT. The performance, and the tearing were simply awful. This just solidifies in my mind how bad Nvidia really is. From now on it’s ~ATI~ AMD graphics cards for me!

So here’s the nitty gritty specs. It’s the top of the line 17”

**Processor:**  
Intel Core i7 - 2.3 GHz - Quad Core (Hyper Threading Technology)

L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB  
L3 Cache: 8 MB

**Memory:**  
4 GB DDR3 - 1333 MHz (upgrade to 8 GB is in the mail, on it’s way to me!)

**Graphics:**  
1\. Intel HD Graphics 3000, VRAM 384 MB (integrated, lower power consumption)

2\. AMD Radeon HD 6750M, VRAM 1024 MB (discreet, higher power consumption, much higher performance)

Computer switches between the graphics cards automatically on the fly depending on whether you are connected to a power source or not. Though you can disable automatic switching if you so desire.

**Hard Drive:**  
750 GB

And now we come to the really cool part, but the one I have not yet been able to make use of. This laptop includes ~Lightpeak~ Thunderbolt!

Now, it’s going to be a while before there are any peripherals for Thunderbolt, but the technology is, I think, going to revolutionize the industry. It’s very fast, it can support up to 6 devices via daisy chaining, and it’s adaptable. And this is why I said earlier that I needed the Express/34 Cardslot \*for now.\* At some point I expect there will be an eSATA adapter for Thunderbolt, at which point my Cardslot will no longer be necessary. Believe me when I say I am very excited to see where Thunderbolt technology goes.

So anyway, I’m enjoying my new laptop on all levels.
