> Kids today have missed the whole experience of putting the headphones on, turning it up to 10, holding the jacket, closing their eyes and getting lost in an album; and the beauty of taking your allowance money and making a decision based on the jacket, not knowing what the record sounded like, and looking at a couple of still pictures and imagining it.

Yeah um… where do I begin?

First of all, as good capitalists are wont do, Steve and Apple saw an opening in the market. That opening was in the form of giving the consumer power, tools, the ability to choose. Demand drove the market, technology became available.

As an artist, you would think he would be glad for people to be able to preview his songs before buying. Then they could here how good he is and say, “I just gotta have that album…”

Oh, wait, that only applies to good artists. But I digress (and probably offend if you like Bon Jovi).

You see, in the olden days of records and albums and such, one would be forced to buy an entire album with perhaps one or two songs they like out of the whole album. But no more! Those days are gone and good riddance! I certainly have some entire albums in my iTunes library, and I have a lot of singles, songs that are good, but the rest of the album isn’t really.

You see, the people who are really killing the music industry (if I may borrow that term) are the one’s failing to adapt to today’s market, to today’s technology, to today’s consumers. But they aren’t _really_ killing the music business, they are just becoming irrelevant. And it’s their own fault!
