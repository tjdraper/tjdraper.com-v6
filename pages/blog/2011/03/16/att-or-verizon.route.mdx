[BGR - Why I switched back to an AT&T iPhone](http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/16/why-i-switched-back-to-an-att-iphone/) The mythical Verizon iPhone isn't everything it's cracked up to be, at least according to some. I haven't had Verizon service in several years (since day one of the original iPhone on AT&T), and I've had limited experience with a friend's Verizon iPhone so I'm not really in a position to make a good determination. However... I can tell you that here in Franklin, AT&T isn't as good as Verizon. There are places I go in Franklin where AT&T has 2 bars, walk in to a building and signal seems to go away almost completely. I know in those same places back when I was with Verizon I had good signal. Further north in Nashville, AT&T seems to do better. Also, there are now some places I go where Verizon doesn't have any signal, but I can get AT&T EDGE. At this point I'm of the opinion that there are merits to either carrier, but I'll probably stick with AT&T for now (even when my contract expires) because it's a bit cheaper. A lot of my calling right now is in calling (AT&T to AT&T), and so I don't use very many anytime minutes. Hence I am on the Family Talk 550 plan for $10 less than Verizon's lowest (700 minutes) plus I get roll over for those months that I do need to use more minutes. Additionally, the cheapest (only, as far as I know) iPhone data plan on Verizon is the $30.00 unlimited. With AT&T I'm on the DataPro 2GB plan for $25. Added up, that's $15 less per month! Yes I still think it's stupid that AT&T hasn't yet rolled out their 3G network to the majority of their native footprint, but [indications are that they have realized they probably aught to get crackin' on that](http://www.att.com/network) so we'll see what happens. And yes, I still get irritated when I am in what is supposed to be a good 3G coverage area and get kicked over to 2G EDGE. And yes, I still get infuriated with AT&T's in building coverage... However, because of price, and the fact that I'm happy enough with my iPhone 3GS that I don't have a burning need to upgrade to a new iPhone this year, I plan to let my contract expire and stay on month to month with AT&T for a while and watch things play out in the 4G arena.
