People who (think) they know me might assume that I would be opposed to Chrome since it’s not made by Apple, but I actually do like Chrome. On a scale of 100, I’d put Chrome at like, an 85 (and I’d put Safari for Mac at 90, there is no browser yet I’d rate at 100).

I’ve gone entire days using only Chrome, just to make sure I was rating the browser properly in my head. It’s a good browser and I like it.

I haven’t had a chance to actually test drive this new version yet, but I love the concept of the new preferences.
