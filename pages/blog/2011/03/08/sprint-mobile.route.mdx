So this has been making the rounds today.

> Of course, a Sprint T-Mobile merger would create a nightmare of networking problems that may be too much to overcome. T-Mobile currently uses GSM technology and HSPA+ for 4G while Sprint uses CDMA and WiMax for its 4G services. These are not interoperable, so you’re looking at dual-mode devices for this entity for the first few years.

Uhh, yeah. Does this seem like a bad idea to anyone else. Of course Sprint has already proven they make stupid moves like this once before (anyone remember the fiasco that was the Sprint/Nextel merger?).

Well anyway, Sprint has no coverage where I live (Verizon 1x RTT roaming only), and T-Mobile also has no coverage where I live (and for some strange reason T-Mo isn’t allowed to roam on AT&T here in my area, anyone who comes here with T-Mobile gets zip, nada, zilch coverage). So, 0+0 would seem to equal 0 to me.

And again, this would seem like it would cause a nighmarish monstrosity of technologies. I just don’t see how any of it could be integrated in a way that makes sense, especially monetarily, for either company.
