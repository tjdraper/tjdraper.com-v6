> A new rumor claims Apple will hold its annual iOS roadmap event in early April to show off iOS 5 as expected,

That would pretty much be right on time, and I’ll be looking forward to see what Apple will unveil this time around. I’m fairly happy with my iPhone right now, happier than I’ve ever been. But I have my list of things I would like to see…

This wouldn’t surprise me. There have been signs that Apple has something up it’s sleeve. And they certainly shifted to make a major focus on the Mobile aspects of the former dotmac service when they revamped into MobileMe. Therefore including another revamp announcement as part of an iOS event would seem to be logical to me.
