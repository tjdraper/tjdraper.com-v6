> **Resize Windows From Anywhere** In Lion, you can resize windows from any border, just like in Windows. This is a pretty radical change for Mac OS. Some even said it couldn’t be done because of how thin OS X window borders are. The traditional resize handle at the bottom right corner is gone, too, probably due to the addition of iOS-style scrollbars that fade in on mouse-over.

I just have to say, this is a sad day in the advancement of OS X. I don’t consider this an advancement at all but a step back. Having one specific place on the window where you grab it and resize it is a much better approach. I remember with Windows, I was always trying to get the resize cursor to grab the corner so I could resize height and width at the same time. In OS X, that’s the only way to resize a window (until now), and it makes a lot of sense. It also prevents accidental resizing of the window, which I have done a fair few times in Windows as well.

Simply put, I’m very happy with this behavior in the current consumer version of OS X and I’m sad to see it changing. It’s a small thing and I’ll get over it, but it’s the small things that make us Mac users love Apple.
