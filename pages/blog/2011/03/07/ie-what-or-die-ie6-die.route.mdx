I cannot tell you how happy it will make me when IE6 is completely and totally dead! Trying to get my HTML and CSS to play nice with the latest versions of all the most popular browsers, plus IE7 is bad enough (I typically have to define a stylesheet specifically for IE7 to give it special instructions sometimes, itâ€™s really pathetic!). Trying to support the non-stadards compliant monster called IE6 requires the phase of the moon to be just right!
