Boy, the [rumors](http://www.tipb.com/2011/03/07/iphone-5-set-abandon-glass-favor-aluminum/) are [just](http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/03/07/iphone.5.may.use.aluminum.shell/) a [pouring](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/07/apple_rumored_to_ditch_glass_back_for_aluminum_with_iphone_5.html) [in](http://www.9to5mac.com/54764/iphone-5-to-have-aluminum-back-new-antenna-design/) that iPhone 5 will be going to back to an aluminum back.

I don’t favor the fake mock up making the rounds, I prefer a flat back myself. However, I would be highly in favor of going back to aluminum. I certainly never cared for the idea of glass on the back much. Seemed silly to me. And I’ll have to say I’m not a big fan of the plastic on my 3GS. I do like the flat aluminum back of my original iPhone though, and I would be happy to see it return.
