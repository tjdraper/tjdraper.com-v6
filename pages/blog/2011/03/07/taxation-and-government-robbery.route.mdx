Oh hey look, I have a blog…

Seriously, it is my intention to blog a little more often, but I know I have said this before. Anyway, I wanted to share an Article that I read today and really like:

[Blog and Mablog - Like Pirates on the Beach](http://dougwils.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8489:like-pirates-on-the-beach&catid=146:mere-christendom)

And for just an excerpt:

> So there are basically three questions. The first concerns whether or not there is such a thing as taxation which is not theft. And the answer is yes—there is such a thing as lawful taxation (Num. 3:47; Rom. 13:7). It does exist. To maintain that all taxation is theft by definition is to take a hard libertarian/anarchist view of civil government which is not warranted in Scripture.

And:

> Ten percent is significant because that is what Almighty God claims. The tithe of God is a prerogative of God. I don’t believe that it is possible for a king, or a congress, or a parliament, or a president, to claim that much or more without setting itself up as a rival to God, which is exactly what our governments have done.
