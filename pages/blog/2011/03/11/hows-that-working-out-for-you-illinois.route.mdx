In a seriously stupid move, [Illinois on Thursday decided to start taxing Amazon.com](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704399804576193212782052704.html), based on affiliates that refer traffic to Amazon.

> The Illinois law, signed by Gov. Pat Quinn Thursday, requires online retailers that work with affiliates in the state to collect sales taxes on purchases made by Illinois residents and businesses.

And so Amazon responded:

> Amazon responded to the measure by cutting ties to its Illinois-based affiliates, which are blogs and other websites that refer traffic to Amazon’s website and get paid commissions if customers make purchases there.

So let’s review. Illinois government feels it doesn’t suck enough blood sweat and tears out of people, so it wonders how to get more money.

“Oh, oh, I know,” someone says, “let’s tax Amazon!”

But someone (surely someone, anyone…) wonders aloud, “How can we tax an entity that has no physical presence in the state of Illinois and is therefore not subject to Illinois laws or tax?”

And so someone says, “Hey, I think there are people in Illinois that run blogs and websites which link to Amazon. That means we can tax them based on that!”

And so, the law is written and signed…

And Amazon cuts ties to the affiliates. Effectively reducing incoming cash to the state of Illinois.

Brilliant, just brilliant. Great one for the books fellas!
