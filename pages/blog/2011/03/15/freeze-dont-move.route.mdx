Frankly I’m glad someone else noticed. I was beginning to think it was just my laptop. It hasn’t been bad enough to take it in for service, but there’s definitely an issue. It seems to me like a driver problem. I remember similar problems at first when the Core 2 Duos came out.

I’ve learned how to avoid it, but it’s kind of annoying. For instance, for whatever strange reason, rebooting my VMWare Fusion Windows XP virtual machine will cause a kernel panic during the XP logo sequence… Every time!

Less predictable are large file transfers. I have triggered a panic with large data transfers.

I have also discovered that rebooting every day produces less kernel panic problems.

All this points to new drivers for new hardware needing the kinks worked out. It’s the price we sometimes pay for being on the bleeding edge.

I’m still very much enjoying the blazing fast speed of my new MacBook Pro.
