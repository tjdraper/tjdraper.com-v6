Let me break this down for you, my dear readers.

Problem: Many of the American people were stupid and went and got loans they couldn’t pay for housing they couldn’t afford.

Problem: Lenders were stupid and gave loans to people that couldn’t afford them.

$700 billion bail out DOES NOT EQUAL SOLUTION!!!!!!!

If I were to loan out money to someone who could not pay me back should the government come in and bail me out? If they did I would be thinking, hey, this worked out okay I’ll just do this again.

So basically the idea is to take the American people’s tax money and buy bad mortgages from stupid lenders so that stupid people can stay in the housing they can’t afford.

Yep, I think that about sums it up.
