1.  Drive 1,700 miles round trip
2.  Hang out with the Fam at Silver Dollar City
3.  Ride Roller Coasters
4.  Crack Windshield in Car

Wait, HUH?

Yep!

My new car (55,000 miles), decides it cannot strike at my finances mechanically, it being so new and all. So it went and found probably the only rock flying around on the Interstate and ran right into it.

Little rock at 70 mph equals cracked windshield.

I didnâ€™t actually get a picture of it after it spread, but I did get initial pics:

That cost me $250.00 to get the windshield replaced.

Fun times!
