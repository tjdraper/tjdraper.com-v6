How do I know? Because our “Republican” president is one of the front runners on this insane $700 billion bailout, which essentially completely undermines capitalism and a free market society.

> President Bush, saying he decided to “act, and act boldly,” has sent a request to Congress for up to $700 billion to let the federal government to buy up bad mortgages in a move to stem a widespread economic meltdown.
> 
> Bush pledged Saturday to work with Congress to quickly pass the rescue package. And he deflected conservative criticism that the government is taking an overbearing approach to stabilizing the financial markets.
> 
> “My first instinct was to let the market work,” Bush said. But after being briefed by experts on the scope of the problem, he said he realized a “robust and strong” bailout was needed.
> 
> “It is a big package because it was a big problem,” Bush said. “The risk of doing nothing far outweighed the risk of the package.”

UN-BELIEV-ABLE!!!
