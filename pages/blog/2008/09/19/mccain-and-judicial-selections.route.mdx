In the circles in which I run the political arena is a most sticky place… I’ve wanted to post so much more on this issue but two things have kept me from doing so.

1.  Time, I got no time
  
3.  Even some of my closest friends are divided on this issue

However, I can’t help but link to this article that I feel is such a good article.
