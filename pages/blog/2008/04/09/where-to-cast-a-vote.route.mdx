So in general I have 3 categories I can place political candidates in. In theory there’s 4, but I’ve never heard of a candidate fitting into number 4. So here are the categories:

1.  **Dead in a Ditch**: This is the category where I’d rather be dead in a ditch than to see this person in office
2.  **Hold my Nose**: This is the category where if they make it into office I can hold my nose and the stink doesn’t smell so bad. In some cases, if there is no other option I could vote for someone in this category… maybe…
3.  **The Realm of Sanity**: There is usually some little things I wish weren’t so with this candidate, but by and large like them.
4.  **GODSEND**: I don’t know any candidate anywhere or time that I would put in this category.

So let’s see, where does that leave me in the current state of politics in our country in regards to presidential elections?

-   Hillary “rob’em” Clinton - Dead in a Ditch
-   Barack Obamanation - Dead in a Ditch
-   John McPain - Dead in a Ditch

Well, well… I’m already starting to feel the muddy ditch water closing around me… there are no sane persons left in this country save but a very few…
