Okay, so I was listening to Phil Valentine on SuperTalk 99.7 (Nashville area station), and I heard him talking about how the Government is mandating the use of Ethanol in gasoline and how 30% of our corn is now used for the production of Ethanol (I also read it somewhere, can’t remember where now). Of course as a result food prices go up and fuel prices go up (and like any conservative talk show host he was outraged!).

You see, what we have here is the government meddling in things it has no business with! Whenever you add the government in on the mix, doesn’t matter what it is… unless it has to do with the biblical place of government which is punishing evil doers, then it’s just a mess! Just take a look around in this country and you can see this phenomenon at work. Anything our government touches falls all to pieces. But that’s what happens when you interfere with Capitalism, it’s just not Capitalism anymore!

You know what’s crazy? As the government messes our Capitalism up more and more, people start screaming more and more for the government to come in and fix the problem. I hear it all the time, “The government needs to do something about the economy.”

O yeah… like what? See the problem is any problem we are having with our economy is already because of government involvement and regulations. They can’t fix something they aren’t supposed to be messing with. And yet it seems that the driving issue for most Americans in this election is “what will the candidate do for the economy?” I can answer that, if he’s a Godly candidate that knows the Biblical place of government, and if he understands capitalism, he will do NOTHING for the economy except LEAVE IT STINKING ALONE!

I hear all this non-sense about sending Americans some sum of money (I’ve heard different numbers on the amount of money, I think it may vary depending on some criterion or other), this is of course tax money. And I’ve even heard Pres. Bush refer to it as a booster shot in the arm for the economy. It really just makes me sick. It sounds a lot like a re-distribution of wealth to me.

You know, there is a system wherein the government interferes with the economy, and where wealth is re-distributed. It’s called SOCIALISM!
