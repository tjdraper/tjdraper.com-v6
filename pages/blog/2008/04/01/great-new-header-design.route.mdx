I’ve got a great new header design for the site, what do you all think?

I think it looks pretty spiffy!

UPDATE: This was part of an April Fools Day joke (I thought it was pretty cute but who knows if ya’ll did). The header has been returned to it’s normal random rotation of pictures. Here is what the header looked like:

Also note, if the header has still not returned to normal for you, try refreshing your browser.
