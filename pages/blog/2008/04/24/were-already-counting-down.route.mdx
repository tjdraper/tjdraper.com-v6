As you can see by the baby-gaga ticker right below the nav-bar of the site, we are already counting down to when our second baby will be born. Yes, we’re super excited! So, if you are reading this via RSS, get yourself to the site and take a look at the ticker!

In other news, I did away with the links page and added all our links to the side bar. The links page just wasn’t working out the way I had envisioned it. I’ve actually made some other changes to the side bar too, mostly just adding stuff. Be sure to check it out!

Peace… Live long and Proper… all that good stuff!
