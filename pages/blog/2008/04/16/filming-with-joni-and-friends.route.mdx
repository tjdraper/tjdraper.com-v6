I had the privilege of being on the film crew in San Antonio this past Monday and Tuesday where we were filming for the [television show](http://www.joniandfriendstv.org/) being produced by [Franklin Films](http://www.franklinfilms.com) for [Joni and Friends](http://www.joniandfriends.org/). Joni really is an amazing person and I was blessed to be able to meet her, even though I was kept quite busy with my duties and didn’t get to talk with her much.

I took a couple minutes to snap off some photos with my iPhone. I think my iPhone camera lens is getting just a bit foggy as you will be able to see…
