Hey, didn’t we used to live in a free country? Then ‘splain this one to me:

[Christian photographers fined for refusing same-sex ceremony](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=61342)

So.. Yeah… so much for that free country business.

You know, what “anti-discrimination” means is, everyone has rights except for Christians… you know the same kind of folk that founded this country…

Sigh!
