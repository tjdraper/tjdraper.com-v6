To those of you who are observant, you may have noticed that the header died for about a day (that’s how long it took me to realize it)...

My header uses a PHP script to rotate the header pictures that is dependent upon the physical server directory path to the directory (folder) containing the header pictures. Having just recently upgraded my reseller account, and the upgrade requiring that I move all my sites to another server, the physical server path did change for my root account because my username changed.

Well anyway, I forgot to update the physical server path in my PHP script until today when I visited my site and the header didn’t load.
