The house has passed and the President signed the bill which hastens our decent down the black hole of economic demise.

  

  

Not that I expected anything different in the long run, but I guess I had held to a shred of hope when congress voted it down the first time. Sigh.

  

  

I haven’t heard how my rep voted yet but she seemed pretty deadset against it when I heard her on the radio yesterday so I hold out hope that I can point my finger in a direction away from myself ![wink](wink.gif).

  

  

It is interesting to see how the Dow responded both the first time when everyone thought this would go through, and how it shot back up the next day when it was voted down. And how now it’s lower than it’s been in 7 years!
