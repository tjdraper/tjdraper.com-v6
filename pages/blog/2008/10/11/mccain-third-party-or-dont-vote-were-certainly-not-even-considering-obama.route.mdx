  McCain, Third Party, or Don't Vote? (we're certainly not even considering Obama!)

I want to address an issue that has been coming up lately (for me anyway).

Now be forewarned as you move forward in this post, as many of you are probably aware by now given my recent trend in posting, I have indeed altered my position to some degree.

"I don't like any of the choices" is the cry I'm hearing regarding the upcoming presidential election. Well, I see one of two options for you:

1. Start a revolution and take the country back by force
2. Vote strategically

Not much of a choice at this point really. 1 Timothy 2:1-3 tells us:

> 1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

Now I will submit to you that the current system of government, our Representative Republic (no we are NOT a democracy), is the construct that we've been given to work with. In the light of 1 Timothy 2, how are we to vote? Well I think it's pretty clear that we need to vote in such a way as to lead quiet and peaceable lives. We vote the best we can given the circumstances, and we pray for those that are in authority. The element of being able to vote and have a voice adds an additional element of accountability for certain. We are to be salt and light and we do this by any and all means accessible to us. To debate whether our current form of government is the most Godly or Biblical is another topic for another day. It completely ignores the issues at hand in my opinion.

And so we come to my key point. I think too many Christians are becoming political perfectionists/idealists. When we can't have the perfect candidate, then we go rant and rave, throw a tantrum and generally make fools of ourselves. We berate our government and our nation's leaders. I have certainly been guilty of this given our recent bailout package, but I better move on from that before I become both sidetracked and outraged again...

Please don't misunderstand me. I don't think we should be naive, and I don't think this means we can't talk about the problems and errors we see, for we should certainly be aware of the problems and pray for our leaders, those that are in authority. And because we have the element of having a voice, we need to be aware of issues even more so. But we have to understand that unless the political candidate were Christ himself, that candidate will never be perfect. I admit that some candidates are better than others.

Which brings me to strategic voting. I will, in all probability be voting for McCain. Why? you ask. Well, here's why. I believe that there are two basic issues on which to vote (listed in the modern vernacular).

1. Social Issues
2. Economic Issues



Social issues encompass things such as perceived rights, abortion, homosexual "marriage" and so on. Economic issues have to do with things like the bailout, governmental involvement in markets etc.

By far and away, the primary issues when I consider any candidate are the social issues. Allow me to illustrate. Let's say you see on your right hand, about 100 yards away some shmoozing sales guy, or other sleazy character is dealing dirty with some guy, some monetary issue. And over on your left about 100 yards in the opposite direction, a guy is about to kill some poor innocent and defenseless person. Which person do you attempt to rescue first?

To any self respecting Christian I should hope the answer is clear. Choosing to rescue the person about to get killed is certainly the lesser of two evils, because ideally you would be able to take care of both things at once, but you can't. So hopefully you'll deal with the near death situation in time to come back and take care of the other, less important situation. And as far as I'm concerned that's where we are at. Despite my previous uproar, the economic issues are of very little concern in light of the holocaust this nation is enduring, and the blasphemy of God's word and laws in the exercise of legalizing so called "Gay" marriage. How can we possibly really be all that worried about corrupt politicians taking our money and giving it to Wall Street in light of these far more important matters?

So I'm perfectly willing to compromise on those issues if I can gain ground on the more important issues.

Let me present a Voter Issue Guide that will help put things in perspective.

This is precisely why I get so irritated when I hear people tell me that there is no difference between John McCain and Barack Obama. I'm here to tell you THERE MOST CERTAINLY IS! You're kidding yourself if you think there is no difference. In my opinion, McCain has it where it counts! Is he the perfect candidate? Most certainly NOT! His stand on economics is horrible (though perhaps slightly better than Bush). And he does advocate abortion in the case of rape, which I think is wrong. But there is so much ground gained by voting for McCain, and in my opinion, in this vote there is much ground to be lost by voting third party.

And I don't have the heart right now to address the idea that "If I were going to vote, I would vote for Barack because it would send a wake up call to our nation."
