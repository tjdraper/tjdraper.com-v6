On the campaign trail Obama said something to the effect of:

> They found out that when I was in school I would split my peanut butter sandwich in half and share it and now they call me a redistributionist

I’m telling you what, this man has a major problem if he can’t tell the difference between sharing his own sandwich, or reaching over to another kid’s lunch bucket and sharing that sandwich!
