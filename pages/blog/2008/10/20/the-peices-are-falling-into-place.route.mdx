...and it appears we are going to have an Obamanation! Yes, our Country is that far gone!

Read: [Obama Endorsed by Colin Powell](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/19/AR2008101900598.html)

Let me just say right here, yes I believe God is sovereign and whatever happens in this election will be His will. And if Obama is elected let me say that this will not mean that judgement is coming. I full believe that if Obama is elected it will mean judgement is here!

Consider that we have a Democratic majority in the house and senate, and Obama would be the most left wing liberal President we have ever seen. As an ultra conservative, capitalist human being I shudder to think what will happen to our country if this come to be, but enough of that because as I said, God is sovereign and he knows what heâ€™s doing.

It will be interesting to see which way God takes this.
