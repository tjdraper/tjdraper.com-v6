Iâ€™m going to be making use of the Mobile Me Gallery (formerly Dotmac Gallery) so that anyone who desires to can see more pictures that I have time to post on the blog.

Mobile Me makes it drag and drop easy to publish the pics to my gallery from iPhoto. And you can subscribe to photo updates via RSS, or if you have a Mac, directly in iPhoto.

The URL to the gallery will reside in the sidebar, or you can get to it [HERE](http://gallery.me.com/tjdraper).
