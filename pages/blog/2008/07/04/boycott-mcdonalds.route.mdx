I suppose this is an easy one for me to do since I really hate McDonalds food anyway and already mostly avoided it.

I know we have to pick our battles, but it looks like this boycott is gaining momentumâ€¦

I realize that probably every major food chain has some problem or other but maybe this will send a message, and McDonalds is being very open and flaunting this one right in our faces.
