About the van… yeah… well…

The van started missing really badly… I mean really badly! We took it in to the shop, and to make a long story short, the cost of fixing the van was going to be upward of $1500.00. Not the kind of money we wanted to sink into a vehicle with 250,000 miles on it.

Enter the new car. It’s a 2003 Mazda Protegé. We didn’t really need a mini van anyway at this point in our lives. We figure by the time our family grows large enough for a mini van (if the Lord blesses us) it will be time to trade my Escort in…
