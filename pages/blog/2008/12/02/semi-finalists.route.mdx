I’ve been a little negligent in posting this announcement, but as I said in my previous post, “better late than never.”

3 of the films we submitted to the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival have moved on to be semi-finalists.

 -   [An American Adventure](http://www.franklinsprings.com/films/jimmygentry/)
 -   [A Full House of Blessing](http://www.franklinsprings.com/films/fullhouse/)
 -   The Terri Schiavo Story (a two part television special for the Joni Eareckson Tada television show)

Go [HERE](http://www.independentchristianfilms.com/program/) to see all the semi-finalists.
