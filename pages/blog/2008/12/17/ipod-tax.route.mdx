What’s next, a breathing tax, how about a tax for “just being alive.”

I know, let’s impose a tax for owning land… oh… wait… we’re there.

Seriously, tax me for downloading music??? This is incredible. Oh, I know what the problem is, we don’t have enough taxes that’s why we have a budget deficit! Big government is the problem you say??? Come, that’s an outdated notion!

Oh, and make no mistake, while this is only being proposed in New York, other states will [follow the path](http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2008/12/15/daily39.html).

> New York Governor David Paterson has reportedly proposed a so-called ‘iPod tax’ on downloaded music and entertainment services to help his state close a $15.4 billion budget deficit.
> 
> The Daily News reported that Apple Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) products aren’t Paterson’s only targets. He has proposed 88 new fees and taxes that go far beyond, including on movie tickets, taxi rides, soda, beer, wine, cigars, massages, cable and satellite TV.
> 
> “This is where we are,” the paper quoted Paterson as saying. “Maybe we should have thought about this when we were depending on what we thought was inexhaustive collections of taxes from Wall Street — and now those taxes have fallen off a cliff.”

Now, here’s a little sanity:

> No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth. - Ronald Reagan
