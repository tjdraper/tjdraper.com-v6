With great joy during this Advent season, we welcome into our home this precious gift from God, our first daughter, Natasha Grace Draper.  
  
After stop and go labor starting on the evening of December 23, Rachel finally went into definitive labor at about 10:00pm on Christmas Eve and gave birth to Natasha at 1:16am on Thursday, December 25. The Lord has greatly blessed Rachel with an easier labor than her first labor with Allen, and for that we are extremely grateful. The Lord has also blessed Natasha with very good health. As her Grandma Price has said many times already today, "She's just perfect."  
  
The name Natasha is a form of Natalie, which means born on Christmas day. We chose this name before she was born because we knew she would arrive around Christmastime and we thought that would be as close as we would ever get. Little did we know that Natasha would actually be born on Christmas Day. And of course the middle name Grace, because we truly desire to raise a beautiful, Godly, and graceful daughter upon whom God will indeed bestow much grace.  
  
Allen has been wonderful with Natasha, as you will see below in the pictures. He wanted to hold her right away when he woke up this morning. Though we can see we will need to work with Allen on being gentle, he does seem quite fond of baby Natasha!  
  
We earnestly covet your prayers as we raise Natasha in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and we wish you and yours a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!  
  
In Christ Our Lord,
