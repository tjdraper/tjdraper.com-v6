Yes I know there has been a lot of politics on this blog lately, but I can’t help it. This stuff just makes my blood boil!

Here’s a quote for you:

> On Monday, December 1, a SWAT team with semi-automatic rifles entered the private home of the Stowers family in LaGrange, Ohio, herded the family onto the couches in the living room, and kept guns trained on parents, children, infants and toddlers, from approximately 11 AM to 8 PM. The team was aggressive and belligerent. The children were quite traumatized. At some point, the “bad cop” SWAT team was relieved by another team, a “good cop” team that tried to befriend the family. The Stowers family has run a very large, well-known food cooperative called [Manna Storehouse](http://www.mannastorehouse.com/) on the western side of the greater Cleveland area for many years.
> 
> There were agents from the Department of Agriculture present, one of them identified as Bill Lesho. The search warrant is reportedly supicious-looking .
> 
> Agents began rifling through all of the family’s possessions, a task that lasted hours and resulted in a complete upheaval of every private area in the home. Many items were taken that were not listed on the search warrant. The family was not permitted a phone call, and they were not told what crime they were being charged with. They were not read their rights. Over ten thousand dollars worth of food was taken, including the family’s personal stock of food for the coming year. All of their computers, and all of their cell phones were taken, as well as phone and contact records. The food cooperative was virtually shut down. There was no rational explanation, nor justification, for this extreme violation of Constitutional rights.

Blood pressure still not high enough? Try [clicking here](http://www.restoretherepublic.org/?page_id=161&xdforum_action=viewthread&xf_id=1&xt_id=495&pstart=0&search_words=) for a little help with that.

I wonder how long it will be before we go from ignoring the constitution in practice, to just outright scrapping it.
