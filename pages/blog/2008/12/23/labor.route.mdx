The time is finally here. Rachel is in labor and Allen is with my parents, and all the aunts and uncles over in that neck of the woods.

We are told the baby is in a good position, as opposed to Allen (he was posterior). Every thing looks good at this point, and we give God the praise for it.

I borrowed my sister’s D80 so I should be able to get some good pictures!

I plan to post an update with pictures here when the baby is born. Stay tuned…
