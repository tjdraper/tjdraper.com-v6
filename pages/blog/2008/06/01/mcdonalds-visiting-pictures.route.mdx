So, I’m not feeling particularly wordy, or in any particular mood to comment on all these photos. So I’m just going to sumarize real quick and then post the pictures in the order they were taken. BTW, all these were taken with my iPhone. Not all that bad for a cell phone.

So anyway, [Elder Lovett](http://heritagecenterville.org/marionsblog/) is on a much needed vacation and [Elder McDonald](http://familyreformation.wordpress.com/) came, with family in tow, to fill the pulpit. We (Heritage) were able to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with the McDonalds… Here’s the pics.
