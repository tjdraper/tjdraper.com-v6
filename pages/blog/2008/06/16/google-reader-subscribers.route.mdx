Of course I’m subscribed to my own blog in Google Reader. I mean you never know when Rachel might post on our blog, because she does that so often… o wait… on second thought… well anyway, moving on.

So I never really noticed the little link up toward the top right corner when you are viewing a feed in Google Reader. It says “**show details**” (which if click magically becomes a “**hide details**” link). Being of the curious sort, and willing to take risks, I clicked that little link while viewing my blog’s RSS feed. That little link gave me a few details. Actually two to be exact, and they are as follows:

1.  This feed has 0.0 posts per week and
2.  There are 11 subscribers to this feed

So this post is two fold. 1. Bring up the post count. 2. I’m bummed that there are only 11 subscribers in Google Reader and since this blog has to be more popular than that (it has to right?) then I must assume my readers are terribly ill informed and don’t know about Google Reader.

Let me assure you that Google Reader is the coolest thing since sliced bread! It lets you keep up with any RSS enabled website without having to check up on the website constantly. For instance, I subscribe to 95 RSS feeds, many of them blogs of folks I like, friends etc. Anytime a blog I subscribed to in Google Reader has a new post it shows up in my Google Reader thanks to that nifty thing called RSS!

[Try it!](http://www.google.com/reader) You’ll love it!

That should help my post count ![smile](smile.gif)
