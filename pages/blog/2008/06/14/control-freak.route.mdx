I think there is a control freak in our family… and no it’s not me.

Let me give you one small example.

Rachel’s MacBook almost always sits on top of the entertainment center, with audio and video hooked up to the television. Now, Macs have this cool program called Front Row, and they also have remote controls. The remote always sits on the shelf next to the rocking chair.

We often use Rachel’s MacBook to play music through the TV by means of the remote and Front Row. When an album or playlist gets done, Allen immediately begins frantically pointing at the shelf where the remote resides practically shouting “Moe, Moe” and then pointing to the TV (Moe means remote)...

Yes, that’s what I call micro management! ![smile](smile.gif)
