YES! My MacBook Pro is maxed out on RAM, and currently has the biggest hard drive one can put in a laptop! It really is amazing. I bought 4 gigs of RAM for $88.00. That’s like dirt cheap… does anyone remember so many moons ago (say like 4 years) when 4 gigs of RAM was something akin to $400.00? Yeah… it’s amazing. And it’s not like my computer was slow or anything, but going from 2 gigs to 4 gigs is just an amazing difference.

I was also running out of hard drive space, so I order the Western Digital 320 Scorpio. $129.00. Amazing… I moved a bunch of stuff of my external drives and back onto my laptop hard drive (like all my photos) and still have 85 gigs free! I’m elated!
