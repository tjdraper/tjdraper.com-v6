Sometimes in this life there are happy moments, sometimes there are sad moments, and then sometimes there is sorrow that is mingled with joy. While we don’t always know God’s full purpose for the things he ordains to happen, we rejoice that he is indeed sovereign and that he does have a plan and purpose. And even while we sorrow in the death of fellow Christians, we rejoice that the Lord has taken them home.

I post to thank all of you who prayed for [Eric Davis](/blog/2008/01/26/urgent-prayer-request) and to let you know that Eric has gone home to be with the Lord. We sorrow with the family he leaves behind, we rejoice that the Lord has indeed taken His servant home, and we rejoice in the legacy he leaves behind.

To God be the glory!
