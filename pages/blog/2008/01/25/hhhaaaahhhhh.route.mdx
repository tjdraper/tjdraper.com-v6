So we kept trying to warn Allen about the dangers of all things hot… specifically things like stoves, irons etc. And you have to understand, Allen is now just tall enough to reach up to the ironing board and touch things like irons!

Well anyway, Rachel was doing something with the iron, she turned her back, and curiosity got the best of the little critter. The iron being hot and all, he got disinterested fairly quickly… but not before he incurred a blister on his middle finger. He was pretty miserable most of the rest of the evening.

The next day, anytime he saw the iron on the ironing board, he was constantly informing us that the iron was “hhhhaaaahhhhhh” (it’s hard to get the pronunciation right on a blog post, it’s basically drawing out the word and forgetting to add the T at the end). As if we didn’t know and hadn’t warned him… ![smile](smile.gif)
