Eric Davis, who is deacon in a church in our [denomination](http://www.covenant-presbyterian.org/) suffered a major heart attack last night. The details have been posted on several blogs so I’m not going to type them out again here but link to a couple:

Under the circumstances it’s hard to feel joyous about anything regarding the situation, but one thing I am glad about is how folks are pulling together to pray for this man. You can see the concern and the care in all the blog posts from folks in our denomination.

Please pray for him and for his family as they walk through this trying time. We ultimately pray for the Lord’s will, but I know I at least pray that the Lord’s will would be to bring Eric through this!
