Have we forgotten God’s first command? This article asks this searching question. I am very much in agreement with this article and very much enjoyed reading it. My good friend [Bryan](http://deolexrex.blogspot.com/) emailed this to me and also got us permission to post it on our blogs and share it with folks. This article appeared in the [Samaritan Ministries](http://www.samaritanministries.org/) January newsletter.
