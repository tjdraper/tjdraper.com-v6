Lately I have been working on several sewing projects. Allen loves to watch me sew. He wants to help as well, but is very limited in what he can do safely. Whenever I sit down at the machine he brings a stool up and watches everything I do. Sometimes he even sits on my lap. Anyway, the other day I finished my seam and had sit back to examine my work. When I looked up this is what I saw.
