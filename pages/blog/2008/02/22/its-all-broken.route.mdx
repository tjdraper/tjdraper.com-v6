So I have now had my first Apple computer go in for a warranty repair. To be sure, we have dealt with one or two warranty issues on Apple computers at [work](http://www.franklinsprings.com), but I’ve never had a personal computer warranty repair so I’m in new territory.

I feel fairly well prepared for this though because 1). I plug in my Leopard Time Machine backup drive at least once a day so even if they maliciously wipe out all the data on my 160 gb hard drive while “repairing” the broken laptop, they can do me no harm, my data is secure. 2). All my email is IMAP so I plug my server, username, and password into the mail client of the computer I want to use and I’m off and running with all my mail and folder structure, flag status, read and unread status all just like on my laptop. 3). Just for this occasion I went for a 60 day trial of a dotmac account so all my notes, bookmarks, to-dos, calendars, etc. will sync with dotmac, and when I get my laptop back, I sync it all back up to my laptop and away I go.

So my MacBook Pro… It was still operational to be sure, but the screen had started to develop this annoying, random flicker (so much for Apple’s new backlit LED stuff, my old powerbook display worked pretty good without all this LED backlit stuff but anyway).

It’s supposed to be back in 7 days, but I’m already missing my good friend. But it’s okay, I’m using Rachel’s laptop until my good and trusty Laptop returns unto me. And she gets to use the clunky old G3 iMac… slow as can be (were we actually able to use 500 MHz processors at one time?), but at least she can access a web browser, email, and instant messaging, you know, the essentials of life in 2008…
