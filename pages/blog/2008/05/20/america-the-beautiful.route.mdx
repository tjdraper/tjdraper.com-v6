The following is a poem written by Judge Roy Moore from Alabama . Judge Moore was sued by the ACLU for displaying the Ten Commandments in his courtroom foyer. He has been stripped of his judgeship and now they are trying to strip his right to practice law in Alabama ! The judge’s poem sums it up quite well.

> America the beautiful,  
> or so you used to be.  
> Land of the Pilgrims’ pride;  
> I’m glad they’ll never see.
> 
> Babies piled in dumpsters,  
> Abortion on demand,  
> Oh, sweet land of liberty;  
> your house is on the sand.
> 
> Our children wander aimlessly  
> poisoned by cocaine  
> choosing to indulge their lusts,  
> when God has said abstain
> 
> From sea to shining sea,  
> our Nation turns away  
> From the teaching of God’s love  
> and a need to always pray
> 
> We’ve kept God in our temples,  
> how callous we have grown.  
> When earth is but His footstool,  
> and Heaven is His throne.
> 
> We’ve voted in a government  
> that’s rotting at the core,  
> Appointing Godless Judges;  
> who throw reason out the door,
> 
>   
> Too soft to place a killer  
> in a well deserved tomb,  
> But brave enough to kill a baby  
> before he leaves the womb.
> 
> You think that God’s not angry,  
> that our land’s a moral slum?  
> How much longer will He wait  
> before His judgment comes?
> 
> How are we to face our God,  
> from Whom we cannot hide?  
> What then is left for us to do,  
> but stem this evil tide?
> 
> If we who are His children,  
> will humbly turn and pray;  
> Seek His HolyFace  
> and mend our evil way:
> 
> Then God will hear from Heaven;  
> and forgive us of our sins,  
> He’ll heal our sickly land  
> and those who live within.
> 
> But, America the Beautiful, If you don’t - the one you will see,  
> A sad but Holy God  
> withdraw His hand from Thee.
> 
> —Judge Roy Moore—
