For those who have Macs, and/or who careâ€¦ ![smile](smile.gif)

Please note if this were named like a Windows Service Pack, this would be SP3. XP has been out since 2001, and they just now made it to SP3. I feel sorry for you Windows sufferers. Good old MS just has a hard time getting the updates out!
