> Over the last several years, Nathan has presented hundreds of concerts at camps, churches, coffee houses, and homes, where his music is appreciated by both the young and old. He continues to defy the contemporary/traditional distinctions, and crosses generational boundaries with ease. And this is part of the goal - to encourage a multi-generational vision for the family and the Kingdom of Peace through a truly musical presentation of the Scriptures and transparent snapshots of life that are convicting, yet full of hope.
