Yes, Frank Pavone is a Roman Catholic Priest, and I’m a protestant. So sue me!

This is a very good video and I recommend you watch it, however, discretion may be advised for younger children.

I was made aware of this video thanks to [Pastor McDonald’s post here](http://familyreformation.wordpress.com/2008/05/04/why-i-am-pro-life/). Speaking of Pastor McDonald, I have been blessed by his vigilance as he posts the abortion statistics for Peoria every week.

The wholesale slaughter of these human beings is certainly one of he biggest blights upon our nation today and I fear and tremble at the judgement God must surely deal to this nation!

Watch the video!
