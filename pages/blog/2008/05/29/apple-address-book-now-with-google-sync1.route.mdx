I cannot tell you how ecstatic I am about this. It’s like a dream come true! Thank you 10.5.3!!!

I have been looking for a way to sync my local address book with gmail EFFECTIVELY for over a year. And suddenly Apple and Google just give it to me! This is beyond joy, this is… is… is… I can’t even find the words to describe it.

And it works just fine. Of course I had so many things out of order in my Gmail address book that I had to do some organizing after I performed the first sync, but now, my iPhone, OS X Address Book, and Gmail address book are blissfully in sync! Now, wherever I go, as long as I have internet access my contacts are with me! Yeah yeah, I can see you all yawning… But you’ll get over it

For those who don’t care about geeky stuff, ![raspberry](raspberry.gif)!
