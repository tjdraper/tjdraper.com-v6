Well apparently if you try to save a co-worker you get fired, according to SuperAmerica company policy:

It’s enough to make the blood boil.

Okay, so they can hire and fire anyone they want for any reason (or at least you should be able to do that, though people don’t think so any more… anti discrimination laws and all that). So they can choose to fire this man, and I can choose to shop elsewhere for gas!
