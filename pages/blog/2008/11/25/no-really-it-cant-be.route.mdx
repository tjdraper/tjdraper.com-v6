...or can it?

Did you know that there [were other automakers in the United States that failed and did not receive a bail out by the U.S. government](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,457509,00.html)?

Well go figure…

Look, I will admit that half of the problem within the auto industry of the U.S. is all the silly government mandates and regulations ranging from fuel economy and safety to who knows what else. But the way to fix it is to remove the government from the equation it doesn’t belong in, not MORE government intervention!
