Dear Readers,

I want to let you know about a most heinous piece of legislation called “The Freedom of Choice Act” (FOCA).

FOCA has many sponsors in both the senate and the house, notable (and telling) are such sponsors as Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator John Kerry, Senator Joseph Lieberman, President Elect Barack Obama, Representative Rahm Emanuel, and many many more in both the senate and the house.

FOCA would establish abortion as a fundamental right (like the right to free speech) and wipe away every restriction on abortion nationwide. It will eradicate state and federal abortion laws that the majority of Americans support and prevent states from enacting any protective measures in the future.

I encourage you to contact your representative, and your two senators and ask them to oppose this heinous, God despising bill! I believe there are many more people against this than for it, but the problem we face now is the same problem we have faced on many occasions, which is apathy and inaction by Christians. There are many liberal activists for this bill, but many more who should be actively opposed to this bill that need to take a stand! Let your representatives and senators know (liberal or not) that if they vote for this bill that you, their constituents, will not re-elect them! Or if you know they are opposed, thank them, and affirm your support against this bill.

Our voice needs to be heard!

Contacting your representative and senators is very easy, and can be done online. I know they pay attention to these forms of communication because I have received acknowledgement on more than one occasion.

Here is the form for contacting your representative: https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml

And here is where you go to contact your senators: http://www.senate.gov/general/contact\_information/senators\_cfm.cfm

And please pray for our country!
