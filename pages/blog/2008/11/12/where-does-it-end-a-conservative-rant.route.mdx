Where do the bailouts end??? How come the government gets to decide which companies receive bailouts? A bigger question, such as in the case of the automakers, is why do we bail out companies who are obviously so big, bloated, and mediocre that they can’t make it anymore?

I guess capitalism works too well, when you let companies fail, so that other, more efficient companies, with higher demand and better products can step up and fill the void, therefore we must interject the government into it! Problem is, this just makes the mess bigger, the clean up longer, and prolongs inevitable failure!
