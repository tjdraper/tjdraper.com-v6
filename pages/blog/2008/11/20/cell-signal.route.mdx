I’ve had a cell phone for over five years now, and today I saw the first evidence that cell providers are actually expanding their coverage!  
  
You see, as far as I can tell coverage has been more or less the same for the last five years with the exception that I got significantly better coverage in Fairview when I switched to AT&T;. And around the country I’ve seen some places where AT&T;is better, and some places where Verizon is better. But I have not personally seen any change or progress on either network until today.  
  
Previously, signal was scarce at our house, and couldn’t be had at all further into Lyles. We limped along by holding the phone a certain way in certain places of the house, though my wife’s junky Samsung is considerably worse at picking up signal than my iPhone…  
  
Well that changed today! As I was getting out of my car I noticed that, quite unusually I had full signal strength. Carrying the phone around the house, under the bed etc. I could not get signal to drop by even one bar. Apparently someone flipped the switch on a new tower.  
  

So there you have it! Hurrah for cell coverage!
