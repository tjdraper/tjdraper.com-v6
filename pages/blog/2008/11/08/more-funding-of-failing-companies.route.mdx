It still just blows my mind, and yet here we are. I don’t think I predicted this here on my blog, but I know that there has been talk among many of us “fringe” conservatives about this coming up.

Have a gander at [THIS](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/08/AR2008110802000_pf.html).

So now we gotta bail out the auto industry. Lets prop up some more mediocre businesses instead of letting a company more qualified step in and fill the void. Forget all this free market crap, it works too well. We gotta take the American people’s money and give it to irresponsible companies that make mediocre products. Let’s not let the manufactures that make better products step up. Let’s not let the American people decide what type of products they need, and when.

Socialism, you gotta love it… wait, no you don’t!
