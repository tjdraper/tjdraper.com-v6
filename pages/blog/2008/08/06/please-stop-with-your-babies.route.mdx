I am convinced that we live in a world where logic and reason are quickly being thrown out the window…nay, flushed down the toilet in favor of complete and utter moronism!

What??? don’t believe me? I offer this article as PROOF POSITIVE that morons exist, and what’s more? they are a force to be reckoned with:

And I quote from linked article,

> FORGET those plans to have a third child for the country because further increases in the birth rate could harm the economy, the nation’s productivity watchdog has warned.
> 
> A major analysis of the nation’s increasing fertility rate said it was at its highest level for 25 years - but the Productivity Commission yesterday warned further increases may aggravate rather than solve the problem of the ageing of the population.
> 
> This is because it will shift women out of the workforce while they care for babies, depressing labour supply and reducing the taxation base as our population ages…

Do people really believe this… uhhh… cow poo poo? Come on seriously, what kind of effect does it have on the economy when THERE IS NO POPULATION? Take this into consideration,

> The replacement fertility rate is roughly 2.1 births per woman for most industrialized countries but ranges from 2.5 to 3.3 in developing countries because of higher mortality rates.\[1\] Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement is 2.33 children per woman. At this rate, global population growth would trend towards zero.

And if you really and truly believe that the world is over populated try flying over just the United States sometime and look down once in a while. Overpopulation MY HIND FOOT (assuming I had a hind foot).

Also be sure to download AND READ the PDF over the sidebar called,“A New Dark Age.”
