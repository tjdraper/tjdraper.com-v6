As I was sitting in the passenger seat today traveling through Colorado, I took the time to read a post on my iPhone and want to share it with my readers (all 2 of them). But firstly, I few notes on this post…

While not ready to draw firm conclusions on McCain’s choice, I believe Pastor Wilson has some great food for thought.

I will also note that I do side with, to \*some\* extent, what I will term here as “choosing the lesser of two evils” because slowing down the car speeding toward the ravine does give us time to get true Bible believers who are interested in building the Kingdom “behind the wheel” to continue the metaphor. But again, only to some extent. And I tend to agree with Pastor Wilson regarding Roe v Wade being a large determining factor.

And lastly, I do know and understand that we must be working on a local level, but to the extent that we care about National politics… Here you go.

Enjoy:
