So, I ran across this article in my Google Reader Shared items. It’s just way too good not to post here as well. I don’t know a lot about the blog it comes from since I’m not a regular reader… but this is a great post none the less.

> I read a [great quote from Pastor McAtee](http://ironink.org/index.php?blog=1&title=that_s_another_way_of_putting_it&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1#comments) on how the Credo-Baptist position essentially views children as salvifically-unviable-fetuses:
> 
> > Credo-baptists believe that soteric worth is tied up with moral agency. Such moral agency is dependent upon consciousness. For Credo-baptists, soteric rights presuppose interests, and creatures without a fairly advanced state of consciousness do not and can not have soteric interests. Hence, until such a time that a child is considered salvifically “viable” as witnessed by a advanced state of consciousness, the child is, salvifically speaking, not a person, but rather is a soteric fetus awaiting enough consciousness to be considered a candidate for soteriological personhood.

> And ironically, the first commenter on Pastor McAtee’s post takes most Paedo-baptists to task with the same logic:
> 
> > Insert Paedo into this article where it reads Credo and some would think that you had certainly made a mistake and truly meant Credo. However, many who would think you made that mistake apply this very reasoning to God’s Covenant children by rejecting them from Christ’s table “until such a time that a child is considered salvifically “viable” as witnessed by a advanced state of consciousness”.

> And if you’d like to be entertained by hearing some Lutherans (Missouri Synod) discuss it, [check this thread out](http://weedon.blogspot.com/2007/03/old-lutheran-quote-of-day_30.html). Pastor Weedon brings out a quote from Luther on 1 Corinthians which explains that the “examine himself” command doesn’t apply to children at all. Its quite telling that Pastor McCain jumps in immediately and begins repeating slogans and ad-hominems as if his life depended upon it. He knows exactly the threat that the quote presents to the anti-paedocommunion establishment, even if others don’t yet see it.
