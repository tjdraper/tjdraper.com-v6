So tonight I was working on getting the sermon posted on the [Heritage website](http://www.heritagecenterville.org/sermons/), and as I’m working on trimming the heads and tales so that it starts and ends smoothly, Allen happened to be walking by my office with toys in hand. As I’m playing back the audio, our Pastor’s voice comes out of the speakers saying. “And God’s people said…” To which Allen instantly says, “Amen!”

He knows the drill ![smile](smile.gif).
