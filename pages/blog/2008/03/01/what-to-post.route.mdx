I’ll tell ya… I get irritated with myself sometimes…

I’ll be driving along, maybe to or from work (probably from since I don’t do mornings very well), and I’ll think of subjects I want to post about on my blog. But whenever I have time to do any posting they have all fled from me.

I will tell ya’ll that Rachel, Allen, and myself have been holding down the fort at my parents farm while they attend a friend’s wedding. We would have liked to go too, but money is a little tight right now and timing stinks as far as work goes.

Well anyway, since all we have at our place is a cat, and my family has horses, dogs, chickens, etc. we are taking care of everything out here. A couple observations…

• 55 minutes to work seems a lot longer than 40 minutes

• I hate satellite internet

• When doing chores on a farm, remember your chore boots!!!

• Chickens are stupid

• 1 mile is a long way to walk to the mailbox (but hey, I need the exercise now that I mostly sit at a desk…)

• Did I mention I hate satellite internet?

• When staying only 30 minutes away from your own house, you should still bring everything but the kitchen sink itself

• O wow, did I mention how I hate satellite internet? ![wink](wink.gif)

Okay, so I’ve lived on a farm for a large portion of my lifetime, and I’ve lived without internet most of my life still at this point. But I still thought this was a fun post!
