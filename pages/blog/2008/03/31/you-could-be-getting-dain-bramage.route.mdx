Apparently, [Cell Phones Could Be More Dangerous Than Cigarettes.](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,343335,00.html)

They say it take about 10 years to really be able to tell. But that’s okay because I figure with the technology moving at such a rapid rate, we are probably up to something that is going to wipe the earth out in a few years anyway and we just don’t know it yet…

I refer you to the episode of Stargate SG1 called [2010](http://imdb.com/title/tt0709030/plotsummary)! Better hope there’s a Stargate around, and someone to predict a Solar Flare so we can loop the Stargate’s wormhole through the Solar Flare, so that those of us still alive when we realize the disaster can send a message to our past selves!
