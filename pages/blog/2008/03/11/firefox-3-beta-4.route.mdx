Being the geek that I am, I have tried out Firefox 3 beta 4 on both the Mac platform and the windows platform.

This version of the Firefox browser does seem very fast. Especially on OS X, specifically the launch time on OS X. Firefox used to take up to 3 times longer to launch than Safari (my browser of choice on the Mac), and then Firefox just felt… heavier (I guess that’s how you put it). Sometimes it would hang for a second while loading a webpage etc. Beta 4’s launch time on the Mac now seems to rival Safari, and it feels snappier and lighter. Not to mention the Mac version of FF beta 4 now looks like a Mac application. I always hated how UGLY Firefox looked next to the rest of my Mac applications.

The windows version of beta 4 seems fine as well, though ugly as anything, but so are all Windows applications so it’s not really Mozilla’s fault.

Here’s the screen shots:
