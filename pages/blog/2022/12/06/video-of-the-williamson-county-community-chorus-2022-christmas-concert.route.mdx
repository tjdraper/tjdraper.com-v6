Follow the link for an iPhone video of the Williamson County Community Chorus Christmas Concert from this past Sunday evening. I'm told there were over 700 folks in attendance, which is amazing. Head to 27:45 for the start of the concert. I have a short solo from a beautiful piece by John Rutter called _A Ukrainian Prayer_ at about 1:11:40 (I'm also in the ensemble singing a special arrangement of _In the Bleak Midwinter_).

I wish we had better audio, but this room audio from an iPhone is what we've got, so, enjoy!
