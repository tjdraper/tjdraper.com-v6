> Advocates of so-called Christian Nationalism now are mostly a part of a protest movement, even if they pretend otherwise.  Secularists deny certain historical truths about America’s founding; the CN camp replies with excessive revisionism of its own.  Secularists scream for the coerced removal of God from the public square; the CN camp replies with advocacy for some coercive notion of their own.  Secularists scream that Christianity has no part of America’s identity; the CN camp seeks to merge Christian and American identities.  I could go on and on.  Things that ought to be acceptable at worst and commendable at best get taken to a place of authoritarianism or nativism out of a temper tantrum.
