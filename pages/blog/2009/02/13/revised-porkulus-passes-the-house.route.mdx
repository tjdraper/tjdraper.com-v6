And of course I’m not surprised, but it’s still so hard to get my head around just how much money this really is! We’re not talking about spending my money any more, or my son’s money. I don’t even think we’re spending my son’s, son’s money at this point. They’re spending money so far into the future I’m not sure which generation’s money they are spending! It isn’t just bad, it’s 100% WRONG! It’s complete and utter foolishness and even downright wicked!

Here’s a couple of choice quotes. First up, House GOP Leader John Boehner of Ohio:

> With a price tag of more than $1 trillion when you factor in interest, it costs every family almost $10,000 in added debt. This is an act of generational theft that our children and grandchildren will be paying for far into the future.

And John McCain:

> This measure is not bipartisan. It contains much that is not stimulative and is nothing short—nothing short—of generational theft since it burdens future generations with so much debt.

It’s as if most people don’t realize that at some point, someone has to pay the piper!

Oh, and here’s a cool website about [Porkulus](http://www.porkulus.org/)!

_Edit: It’s too bad McCain didn’t feel that way about Bush’s Stimulus package!!!_
