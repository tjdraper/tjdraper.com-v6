The current problems we are facing today in the United States go back much further than most people, even “conservatives” believe. Even further back than The Federal Reserve!

I don’t know whether it’s the actual starting place, but many things were certainly set in motion as the result of the Civil War.

Allow me to repost here, a very good little blurb from [Iron Ink](http://ironink.org/index.php?blog=1&title=lincoln_and_freedom_happy_birthday_abe_i&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1):

> **Lincoln And Freedom?**

> For the most part Lincoln worshipers don’t realize that the Great Emancipator suspended the writ of habeas corpus – arresting and imprisoning tens of thousands of people on the slightest suspicion. Thousands of those people were imprisoned for four years without ever knowing what the charge against them was. Lincoln authorized expenditures from the treasury without congressional approval and in the face of a warning from his Treasury Secretary that such greenback printing was unconstitutional, printed the infamous Lincoln greenbacks anyway. Lincoln ordered conscription, which the Chief Justice of the Supreme court believed was unconstitutional. Lincoln closed countless newspapers and jailed opposition editors. This is closely chronicled in “Lincoln’s Warth; Fierce Mobs, Brilliant Scoundrels and a President’s Mission to Destroy the Press.” Lincoln ordered martial law in states where local courts claimed jurisdiction. This martial law had the effect of driving Northern opposition from their homes and from the States where martial law was in force. Lincoln deported a member of Congress, Clement L. Vallandhigham of Ohio, because of his outspoken opposition to the Lincoln administration.

> It has to be one of the great ironies of American history that the tyrant Lincoln is remembered as the man who brought freedom. Even the Emancipation Proclamation was a mockery of the idea of freedom for in the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln freed the slaves who were beyond the ability of the North to enforce Lincoln’s edict while leaving the slaves in bondage who were in border states controlled by the Union.

> The freedom that Lincoln achieved was the freedom of the state to exercise its will at the expense of the citizenry.
