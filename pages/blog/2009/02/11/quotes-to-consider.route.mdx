Here are some of the quotes I’ve collected recently:

> No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth.
> 
> \- _Ronald Reagan_

> Government’s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.
> 
> \- _Ronald Reagan_

> One way to make sure crime doesn’t pay would be to let the government run it.
> 
> \- _Ronald Reagan_

> The most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government and I’m here to help.
> 
> \- _Ronald Reagan_

> The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that government spends too much.
> 
> \- _Ronald Reagan_

> The bottom line is that we’ve become a nation of thieves, a value rejected by our founders. James Madison, the father of our Constitution, was horrified when Congress appropriated $15,000 to help French refugees. He said, ‘I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.’ Tragically, today’s Americans would run Madison out of town on a rail.

> \- _Dr. Walter Williams_

> You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else. When half the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is the end of any nation. You cannot multiple wealth by dividing it.
> 
> \- _Dr. Adrian Rogers_

> Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.
> 
> \- _Winston Churchill_

> Some people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look on it as a cow they can milk. Not enough people see it as a healthy horse, pulling a sturdy wagon.
> 
> \- _Winston Churchill_

> The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.
> 
> \- _Winston Churchill_

And now, included because of it’s utter absurdity!

> I’ve abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system.
> 
> \- _George W. Bush_
