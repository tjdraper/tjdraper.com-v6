This is a Mac post so it may bore you… but I just have to post it. Besides, I need to take a break from posting about our country going down the tubes!

I don’t know if I have many Mac readers that read this blog but just in case they do.

I get tired of people whining about OS X. You know who you are. I read it everywhere all over the Mac and Apple blogs and forums. Apple needs to fix this, Apple needs to fix that. Blah blah. I was pushed over the edge today when I was reading someone complaining about the Finder in OS X. Here’s a good one for you, maybe you’d like to go back to the Finder in OS 9? Yeah, that would be a good idea…

Or not!

Have you forgotten how wretched it really was (yes a “few” people actually still think it was better, but I don’t know how that’s possible). For anyone who actually does think that the OS 9 Finder might have been better, I have an old iMac running OS 9 I’d love for you to use. The Finder is HORRIBLE! Unfit for use! OS 9’s Finder might have been better than the Finder in OS x 10.0, 10.1 or 10.2, but for the last 3 versions of OS X the Finder has been far superior to any other file manager out there.

Yes, I am aware of [Pathfinder](http://cocoatech.com/), and even used it for the 30 day trial period and the fact of the matter is, Finder is superior! And please don’t even try to bring Windows Explorer into this (it’s utterly unusable after using the Finder! Trust me, I know. I have Windows still)

Some people love to say that Apple should re-write the Finder because very little has changed since the OS X Finder first came out and it is extremely outdated.

Let me explain why this is utterly ridiculous in pictures:

Finder in OS X, 10.1 (Puma)

Finder is OS X, 10.5 (Leopard)

So you Apple using whiners, we have the best file manager on the planet so please get over yourselves.

You may now go on about your business. ![smile](smile.gif)
