In principle I am opposed to government bail outs of any scale and I’m opposed to any and all national debt. But I was still having a hard time with the numbers involved in the latest fiasco. I therefore found this illustration most helpful in putting things in their proper context. I suggest you take a good long and hard look at it as well.
