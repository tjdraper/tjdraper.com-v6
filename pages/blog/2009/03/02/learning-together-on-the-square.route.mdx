Beginning Tuesday, March 3rd, Pastor Lovett will begin a 6 week teaching series. It will be an informal but very deliberate time of teaching.

Pastor Lovett will begin this series by going through the Apostles Creed, line-by-line and considering both the theological and practical implications of this historic creed. The Apostles Creed contains the essentials of the Christian faith and is the oldest existing creed we have (dating back to the 2nd century), and churches of different stripes use it regularly to profess the faith of Christendom.

We will be investigating what different phrases in the creed mean, and will spend some time discussing what is perhaps the Creed’s most controversial line, “He (Christ) descended in to hell.”

This study is open to all and we hope you will join us. We will be meeting at Studio D on the Centerville Square.
