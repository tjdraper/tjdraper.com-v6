I’m working from home both today and tomorrow while the rest of the [Franklin Springs](http://www.franklinsprings.com) team is in San Antonio at the film festival… And yes, I’m enjoying myself just fine without the film festival!

No really, not having to make the 15 hour drive (one way) this year is such a relief!

Anyway, so there’s not really a lot of point in my going to the office if I’m going to be the only one there and I’m not doing anything I can’t do at home. Well anyway, my munchkin decided I needed some help:
