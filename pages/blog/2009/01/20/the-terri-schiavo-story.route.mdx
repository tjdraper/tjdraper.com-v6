The Terri Schiavo Story is one that needs told and it has been my great privilege to be able to work on this particular television episode of [Joni and Friends](http://joniandfriendstv.org/)! Originally broadcast as a two part episode, we have repackaged this documentary especially for release through [Franklin Springs Family Media](http://www.franklinsprings.com).

I must say that it will probably be good for me to get away from this project for a while though! My blood boils hotter and hotter each time I get into the project. The atrocities committed against Terri are nothing short of evil. The flaws it reveals in our legal system, and the character of the men that run that legal system are nothing short of astounding! But we shouldn’t be surprised, this is nothing more than the natural progression of a nation that aborts full term babies as a matter of course. And don’t even get me started on the priorities of this nation! Oh, it’s okay to kill a patient that is not terminally ill by starving and de-hydrating her to death! It’s okay to murder babies made in the image of God, but you better not mistreat your dog! You better not kill a snowy tailed spotted owl (or whatever kinds of owls are “endangered”)... but I digress.

Here’s the trailer (which incidentally I edited).
