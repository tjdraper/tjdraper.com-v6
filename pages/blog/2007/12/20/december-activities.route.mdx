I know that I haven’t posted any pictures recently. The reason for this is that I have been very busy getting ready for the Christmas season. But now that I’m done with my shopping and crafts let me share some of the things Allen and I have been doing.

Allen enjoys boxes…they are just so useful.

Even though the musical toys can be annoying, Allen sure does love them. He especially likes dancing to the music on the toy piano.

Books are one of his favorite things, even though he can’t sit still to listen to a story he still likes looking at the pictures and turning the pages. Here he is reading with his uncle Levi.

He was very intrigued with the tree at first. Thankfully, he doesn’t bother it much.

Here are some of the projects that I’ve been working on - reusable gift bags with cross-stitched name tags.

What do you need to entertain a little boy while you cook? Sticks of frozen butter. He was taken with these for a long time.
