Well, Rachel, Allen, and myself made it back from our week long Christmas vacation and are just getting ready to step out the door and head to Worship at [Heritage](http://www.heritagecenterville.org)...

But travels aren’t quite done. Tomorrow morning I pick up Pastor and Caleb Lovett, along with Ted and Elijah Brothers to head down to the [Lingo’s](http://lingohomestead.blogspot.com/) in Georgia to load them up and move them to Centerville!

My wife will be here in Tennessee, but I won’t be back until Tuesday.
