I’ve finally done it! I moved away from Blogger. This site is now powered by Expression Engine Core.

As you can also see, I came up with an entirely new design. I didn’t keep a single element from the old design. Since I’m doing more and more website work, this site had started to become an embarrassment! In my opinion my web-designing skills have improved 100 fold since I did the last design of this site.

For a sample of some of my other work try these:

For those of you who care, and know something about webdesign, there is not one table on this site so far. It’s all CSS. I may resort to using a table on the contact page since I have a basic contact template formatted that I’ve been using for a while now. But if I have a few minutes, I may port it over to CSS just to say I have one site that doesn’t have a table on it at all.

There now, hopefully my next post will be more interesting for those of you who don’t care about technical stuff.
