Yes the rumors are true, I purchased a brand new MacBook Pro in all it’s back-lit LED Glory. Speaking of the technology driving the screen let me tell you, it is GLORIOUS. I have yet to see a laptop that can compare in either brightness or quality. And on top of that, battery life is still great! Better than my Powerbook was new.

I got the top of the line 15.4” model, 2.4 GHz Dual Core, 2gb RAM. Let me tell you it is fast. In fact, it’s faster than the Dual 2.5GHz G5 I normally use at work, though if I need a lot of RAM the Dual 2.5 now has the advantage since we just upgraded it to 4.5gb.

But to give you a real life example of the speed, a video export that took 50 minutes on my 2.33GHz G4 Powerbook, and about 15 minutes on the Dual 2.5 took only 8 minutes on my MacBook Pro. Talk about a big boost to productivity!

And yes, I do have Windows installed via [BootCamp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/), and the beauty is that [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/) recognizes BootCamp partitions so I am able to run Windows inside OS X when I’m designing Websites and need to test in Internet Explorer since that is what 90% of the world uses (it’s a horrible browser, do yourself a favor and [download Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) if you are forced to use Windows), and it is fairly fast in Parallels. And, as weird as it seems, Windows boots right up and runs all by itself if I ask it to…

I did have to upgrade some of my software that I had been holding out on. PowerPC only versions of system level utilities just don’t play nicely on Intel Macs, but I knew that when I purchased the computer. I also knew that the Universal Binary upgrades were available for all my necessary utilities so I just had to bite the bullet and purchase the upgrades.

I got about 3 years out of my Powerbook, let’s see if I can get that much out of this MacBook Pro.
