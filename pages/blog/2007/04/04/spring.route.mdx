I’ve been told I’ve been remiss in putting pictures up here. I must admit that spring has hit in full force and we have been busy doing things around the house. It is a glorious 60 degrees and sunny outside. Last week we did have temperatures of over 80, but it cooled off during the night and I much prefer it cooler.

Last week TJ had a shoot for work in Peoria so we were able to travel up and see my family. Grandpa H. was also able to come for a visit. It was so nice to see everyone.

I have been doing some spring decluttering. I cleaned three large tubs of clothes out of our closet. If you are someone I know personally and are interested in clothes let me know. I have women’s skirts, shirts and sweaters size M/10-12 and men’s shirts size L.

Here are some pictures of Allen.
