As you can see, I have finally taken the time to start adding blogger labels to my 157 (now 158) posts. Labels are good… it was one of the things I really didn’t like that much about blogger when I first started blogging, the lack of labels. With the upgrade to the new blogger, labels are here, but now I have to add them to all my posts. I think I have labeled something like 25 posts now. For now, the only place labels will appear is the bottom of each post. From there you can click on a label to see all the posts within that label. At some point I am going to add a side bar block with all the labels, but that will probably be after I label all of my posts.

I was irritated about one thing in the new blogger though, and that is that I can’t get my archives side bar to organize from newest on top to oldest on bottom without upgrading my template to one of the new layouts template. Since this site is a modification of a Blogger classic template, and since I have spent many hours HEAVILY modifying that template, don’t expect a switch anytime soon! You see, with the old Blogger classic templates, you could copy the code into Dreamweaver for modification, but Dreamweaver doesn’t know what in the world to do with the new layouts template code so I don’t plan to switch right now.

But it’s no worse than it ever was before, and labels are certainly nice.
