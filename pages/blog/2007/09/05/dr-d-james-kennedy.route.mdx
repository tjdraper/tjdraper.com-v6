With sadness I writeâ€¦

This morning at 3:00 AM, the Lord called home his faithful servant, Dr. D. James Kennedy.

I believe Dr. Kennedy was truly used of God and his death will be a great loss to those of us that remain, yet I pray that God will call men to stand on the shoulders of Dr. Kennedy.

May the Lord be glorified.
