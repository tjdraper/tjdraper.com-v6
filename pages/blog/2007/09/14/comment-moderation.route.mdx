Alrighty then, because we seem to have picked up a comment troll who can’t behave themselves, and because I’m still with blogger and can’t ban people, I have enabled comment moderation. I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but if you comment, if the comment is useful, and nice, and not mean, or about subjects I have no interest in discussing on my personal blog, then it will be approved as soon as I can get to my control panel.

Someday I’ll get around to switching over to Expression Engine, then I can allow all comments and ban the trolls. I really don’t like Blogger that much.

I suppose some people just don’t have anything better to do, I pity them!
