For those of you living under a rock, Apple yesterday announced that (among other things) the iPhone would now be only $399.00 for the 8 gig model and they would no longer sell the 4 gig model.

Since yesterday, the entire iPhone user community has been in an uproar. Words and phrases like, “I’ve been cheated” “ripped off” “price gouging” etc. have been floating around. Some who have been Apple faithfuls and buy all the new products are vowing to never be an Apple customer again.

Now, I don’t know how much of this is actually just the media and press picking up on only the negative (since when has a company lowering a product price point been a negative?), but the fact remains that there are a LOT of people whining like little babies because they feel ripped off. But the fact of the matter is, no one has been cheated, no one has been ripped off. This is technology folks. You would think in the year 2007 we would be used to this. Does no one else remember the RAZR? over $300.00 for a stinking flip phone that has (IMO) no really usable features save the actual phone. I don’t remember the exact price, but it was HIGH. And it came down quickly too!

Here are the facts. Apple announced the pricing of the iPhone models well in advance of release. People were forced to think about it. There wasn’t any impulse buying, people went to the store knowing what they were going to pay because they had known for months in advance. IMO, the iPhone is the best phone on the market and Apple had a right to charge whatever they wanted (and still does have the right if they wanted to IMO). The customer had the right to either buy one or not. The customer agreed to pay the price Apple asked for the iPhone. End of story! There is no ripping off or cheating going on here. It’s Apple’s product and those of us who were early adopters felt that being on the bleeding edge of technology by paying $599.00 for an 8 gig iPhone was worth the money. Obviously we felt this way or we would not have purchased the iPhone.

So to the whining iPhone users:

Apple says, for $600 you can have our new iPhone, Customer pays price, end of story. Because it’s not bleeding edge anymore, and they drop the price you feel cheated? That’s just wrong. You’ve had an iPhone longer than the folks who are running to get one now that they are cheaper. You paid to do that, as did I.

I’m perfectly happy with my iPhone, even at $600. Apple doesn’t owe anyone anything, they were quite justified in charging the price that they did, because obviously folks wanted to be on the bleeding edge at that price.

So whimpering iPhone users… GET A LIFE!
