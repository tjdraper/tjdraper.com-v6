Allen turned 1 the middle of last month. My family as well as my grandpa came for a visit. We had a great birthday party hosted at TJ’s parents’ house. Unfortunately, I didn’t get any pictures from the party. (I think David got some though) Grandpa was an immediate favorite with Allen. Below are some pictures of them together that are so sweet.

Allen was always bringing books over to Grandpa to read.

This was such a great picture of my grandpa, I had to include it.
