As of today I have been married to my wife for two wonderful, glorious years! It’s hard to believe it has already been that long, the time has just flown by so fast. It’s hard to express just how much my wife means to me after two years. I have no idea how she has been able to put up with me for so long for one thing!

I am blessed beyond measure to have the wonderful wife that I have, and I am grateful to the Lord for bringing her to me. She is my joy and crown and her price is far above rubies.

May all the years the Lord grants us to be together be as happy and joyous as these first two years have been.
