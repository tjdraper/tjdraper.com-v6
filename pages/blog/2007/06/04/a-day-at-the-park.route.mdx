Last week Allen and I spent a morning at a park in Franklin. We had a great time strolling around a nice paved track and then Allen got to swing, which he thought was great fun. While I ate my lunch he enjoyed playing under the picnic table and tasting nasty wrappers on the ground. He has gotten very bad about putting stuff in his mouth lately. In addition to the wrapper I had to fish a rock and a quarter that day. I guess I better start watching him like a hawk.
