[MovingTruth.com](http://www.movingtruth.com/) is an online community of filmmakers and photographers that my brother-in-law and I started almost one year ago. We are seeking to encourage, lift up, edify, and instruct one another as we endeavor to impact the culture for Christ in our various callings.

David and I have recently re-designed the site, both front and backend. We believe it is now more visually appealing, and easier to use, though the feature set on the new design is not quite done…

MovingTruth seeks to be, to a large extent, a community driven site with user submitted articles, comments, and resources as well as user forums etc. We always need more members so [head on over there and register](http://www.movingtruth.com/member/register/), it’s free!
