Yes yes, I have heard your pleas for an Allen picture update…

Those pleas are being thoroughly ignored! For the time being that is. Life never stops to let me catch up. Stuff keeps piling up (don’t anyone dare come over and look at my desk, I’m being somewhat literal here), and this blog is suffering because of it.

I’ve tried to get my lovely wife to post some pictures because, alas, all the recent pics are on her computer. We can see how much success I’ve been having.

I’ve gotta find time to get the recent pics on my computer too, I’m about two months behind on that.

Oh, and I got an iPhone! It has to be the best all around phone I have ever used and/or seen. And it sure beats the pant off of some of the more popular PDAs (I’m looking at you Palm Treo!). This is not to say the phone is not without it’s shortcomings. But then when you compare to anything else on the market, there is no comparison.

Life is good!
