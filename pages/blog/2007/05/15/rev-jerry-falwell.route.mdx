With sadness I write of Rev. Falwellâ€™s death.

Our Sovereign God decided to call home a great minister of his Gospel today. Rev. Jerry Falwell was found unconscious at about 11:30am, and thereafter pronounced dead at 12:40pm.

Jerry Falwell was used of God in a great many ways, and he shall be missed here on this earth.
