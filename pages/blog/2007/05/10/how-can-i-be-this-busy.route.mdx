Contrary to popular opinion, I am not dead or dying, and I’m posting to prove it. I am so behind it’s not even funny, but that’s nothing new so I don’t know why I’m mentioning it. Since it’s nothing new it really doesn’t make a good excuse.

One thing is for certain, if there are any left who are still subscribed to this blog, or check in on it, it’s an absolute miracle…

Now, I really shouldn’t even be posting, but I’m on “lunch break.” And I really have nothing to say.

I suppose I could mention that there is a conference coming up that I’m helping to plan and promote. Go and register [HERE](http://www.providencelectureseries.org/index.php?page=fanning-the-flames-2007).
