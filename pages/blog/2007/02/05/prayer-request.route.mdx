Dear Readers,

Please pray for Emma Katherine, daughter of Pastor McDonald of Providence Church. Below I am including a post from Pastor McDonald’s blog:

> Our four year old daughter, Emma Katherine, started complaining about pain in her right palm last week. Friday afternoon, we noticed a small lump in the middle of her palm. It seemed to grow over the weekend. Right now, it is the diameter of a nickel and visibly raised.
> 
> We just returned home from the doctor today (the Lord blessed us in locating a homeschooling physician). The doctor’s recommendation is that we have the lump removed right away. He cannot tell what it is, but said it could be cancerous. He had never seen such a cyst like this before. He even brought in one of his colleagues to get his opinion. Of course, our prayer is a benign cyst. Our doctor is contacting a pediatric surgeon here in Peoria to schedule the next step.
> 
> The procedure will take place in the hospital. Emma will have to be sedated.
> 
> We certainly covet your prayers. We serve a sovereign God.
> 
> I will post updates as this progresses.

Here is [the link to Pastor McDonald’s blog](http://www.homeschooltoday.com/blog/jm/) so that you may keep up with things if you wish. Please remember them in your prayers!
