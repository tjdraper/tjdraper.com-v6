Distinctive Marks of Reformed Theology  
Rev. Marcus J. Serven, Th.M.  
(part 1 of 14)

The Doctrine of God & the Trinity:  
Reformed theologians place a resolute emphasis on the holy, sovereign, omnipotent, omniscient, immutable, eternal attributes of God. The Lord has Chosen to reveal Himself in the Bible as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This is not a portrayal of three individual gods (Tri-theism), but of three persons by whom God is fully revealed (Monotheism). The make-up of the Trinity is such that each of the persons is equal in in substance, glory, and power—-yet different in function, role, and activity. Each divine person seeks to serve the wishes of the others.
