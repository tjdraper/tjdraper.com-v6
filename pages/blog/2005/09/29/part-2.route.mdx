Distinctive Marks of Reformed Theology
Rev. Marcus J. Serven, Th.M
(part 2 of 14)

The Doctrine of Holy Scripture:
Historically, the Reformed have always held to a high view of Holy Scripture – the full verbal plenary inspiration, total infallibility, and complete inerrancy of the Bible, Scripure alone, or Sola Scriptura, is the Reformation’s affirmation that the Bible is man’s sole source of authority (John 10:35; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21).  There are some in the Reformed world who have sought to avoid a Reformed Scholasticism by adopting a view of inspiration called limited inerrancy (Bloesch, McKim, Rogers).  This effort has failed and has led, instead, to advancing the views of Neo-Orthodoxy and a truncated view of inspiration (Barth, Brunner, Jewett).
