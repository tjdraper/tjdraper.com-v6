Rachel and I just got back last night from our visit in Illinois. We had a great time. I also got to see my grandma who is doing better. I mean she is at least walking by herself with her walker (slow as she can be but she’s doing it).

I am a little tired this morning, but I’m sure I’ll get over it. Franklin Films is in the process of occupying a new office to go along with the current one so I need to get back to work.
