I’m sorry I haven’t posted in a while. If anybody is still checking this blog (which is not likely since I haven’t posted in, like forever) I have just been really busy. And it will probably get worse before it gets better unfortunately.

Rachel and I are in Illinois for Labor Day weekend. I don’t have to go back to work until Wednesday, so we won’t be leaving here until Tuesday.

Anyway, just wanted to post something.
