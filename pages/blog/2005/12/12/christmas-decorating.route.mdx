Our house is starting to look a bit like Christmas finally (we seem to be slow about such things…).

We have a Willow Tree nativity set and a Playmobile nativity set on each side of our living room bookshelf, and on the top we have garland and lights.

Rachel and I began hanging these the Saturday before last,  but we only had two strands so we didn’t make it past the front door starting from the left of the house.

This past Saturday we hung the rest of the lights that Rachel bought that week. I really do like icicle lights on houses.

It’s not much, but it certainly makes the house more cheery than it was.

After all that work hanging the lights Rachel decided to take a computer break.
