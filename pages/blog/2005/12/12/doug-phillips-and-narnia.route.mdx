When Doug Phillips posts stuff like you see [HERE](http://www.visionforum.com/hottopics/blogs/dwp/?archive=/2005_12_01_index.htm#113415262059617019), [HERE](http://www.visionforum.com/hottopics/blogs/dwp/?archive=/2005_12_01_index.htm#113436542001788174), and [HERE](http://www.visionforum.com/hottopics/blogs/dwp/?archive=/2005_12_01_index.htm#113436940024682221), it makes me not want to link to him when he posts something I do like. I mean I do like a lot of things he posts, but this here stuff is not anything that I like…

I was truly surprised at how good of a job “Hollywood” did with Narnia, but Doug Phillips just can’t seem to get over the fact that it came from Hollywood.

And I’m not trying to run anyone down. I truly do like Doug Phillips, but I just wanted to make it clear that I am in disagreement with him on these posts since I have linked to his blog in the past.
