I find [this article](http://start.earthlink.net/article/nat?guid=20051206/43951ad0_3ca6_15526200512061795013130) very interesting.

No services on Christmas Sunday… eh? What’s going on here anyway? What is this holiday all about anyway? And what right does a church have to cancel it’s regular services because of a holiday that scripture does not command us to celebrate.

Please do not take from this statement that I am against celebrating Christmas (though I used to be). Actually, I am very much for celebrating Christmas. What I celebrate is the triumph of Christianity over paganism. Christ was born and he lived a sinless life. He then died for our sins and rose again. We could let the pagans have the season surrounding Christmas back, but I don’t think that is a good idea. What we need to do is celebrate what is good and holy and pleasing to our God. We have every right to celebrate, but not as the pagans do. We want to reform Christmas. But the way to reform Christmas is NOT TO CANCEL the service of worship in the way that we are actually commanded to worship God. It still stands that no one is required to celebrate Christmas, but we are required not to forsake the assembly. To put it another way, To celebrate a triumph over paganism through means of Christmas is fine, but to cancel the means by which we are actually commanded to worship God does not accomplish the goal. And that goal is furthering Christ’s Kingdom on earth.
