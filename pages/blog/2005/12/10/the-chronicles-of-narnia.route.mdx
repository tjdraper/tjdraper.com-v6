![](/myblogpics/narnia.jpg)Rachel and I went to see _The Chronicles of Narnia_ last night. As one who has never read the books, I thought it was pretty good, and Rachel says that it stayed quite true to the book.

It is by no means as good as The Lord of The Rings series, but it was certainly a movie worth seeing. There also was not the amount of violence that is present in _The Lord of the Rings_. However, there is definitely violence during the battle and in a couple other parts.

_The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ is a wonderful story of betrayal and forgiveness, sacrifice, and good triumphing over evil. I highly recommend this film for most viewers, my only exception might be smaller children because of some of the violence during the battle. Below I will put a small list of ratings in different categories (a lower rating on an undesirable trait is a good thing, and vice versa on a good trait).

Sex and sexual innuendos – 0%

Nudity and/or immodest clothing – 5% _(Unless you would really dock this movie for seeing the male upper body on one character, opinions on this differ from person to person)_

Good Christian Worldview and values – 95%

Good Story Telling – 100%

Film Making Quality – 100%

All quite impressive scores considering most of the films we see these days. However, I hope we are seeing a new trend in pictures. Possibly a growing trend. Though I wouldn’t keep my hopes too high. Still, pictures like _The Incredibles_ with good family values coming from Disney and Pixar, one can hope there is a change upon the winds of filmmaking.

George Grant appeared to like this movie as well [HERE](http://www.kingsmeadow.com/2005/12/aslans-on-move.html). He also linked to an article that I found really good. The article can be read [HERE](http://www.reformation21.com/Movie_Review_The_Lion_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe/132/).
