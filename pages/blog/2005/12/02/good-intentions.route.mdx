I’m always so well intentioned. I intended to listen again to all the messages from the NCFIC conference and then post my comments here, and I still intend to do that. But it is taking me longer than I intended it to…

Right now I am taking a break over lunch. We are very near the finish line for, “The Peasall Sisters - Family Harmony.” If all goes well, we will set it to encode to mpeg 2 (DVD format) over the weekend, and author it on Monday. I highly recomend this film and you can buy a copy at [Franklin Springs Family Media](http://www.franklinspringsfamilymedia.com). If I do say so myself, we do great work. Actually, I think it is because we have such a great director.

My jog today is to get the end credits together, and since my lunch is about over I’m going to post this and get to it.

Maybe more of those comments will be coming along soon… we shall see.
