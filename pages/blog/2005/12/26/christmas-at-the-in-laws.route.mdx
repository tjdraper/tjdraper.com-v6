We went to church on Christmas morning! I must say that it was much better than canceling and staying at home and being self centered! After church, we had a feast in honor of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was really awesome.

Then after church, we had a good time opening presents at the Price’s. Here is a few pictures of the festivites.
