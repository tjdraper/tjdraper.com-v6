On one of the forums I participate in someone said they believed that faith must preceed regeneration.

This was my post in response.

> But the Bible says that faith is a giftâ€¦ how then can we exercise faith to please God first? Does God give the gift of faith to those who are unregenerate?
> 
> God must regenerate us, give us the gift of faith so that we can then please him because our works are as filthy rags.
> 
> If we must exercise faith to please God, and we must exercise faith before we are regenerate, then we must please God to become regenerated. This then is salvation by works because God is saving us because we pleased him with our faith. Unfortunately for this viewpoint, our salvation is not merit based. It is a free gift from God to those whom he choses to give it.
