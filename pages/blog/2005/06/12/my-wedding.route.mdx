Well, it’s finally (and I mean finally) upon us. My wedding is in 6 days. I am so happy I can hardly contain it. For those of you not familar, we go to a small chuch (6 families), and during prayer time they had me come up to the front and they prayed for me. They prayed that I would be a good husband to Rachel, and a lot of other stuff that I can’t remember. Yes, I was a little bit emotional, but it was great having all the men in the church praying for me. It really is wonderful to be involved with a church family that cares for one another.
