I have been listening to sermons by Douglas Wilson on marriage, and have really been enjoying them. They are excellent messages. Rachel has been downloading them as they become available, and as they are only available for a short amount of time on his website, I got behind on downloading them. So when I was in Peoria to visit her last I copied all the sermons over to my computer and then burned them to CD. So now I listen to one every morning on my way to work.

On my way home, if I am not talking to Rachel I usually listen to some sort of music. Once in a while I listen to Classical music, sometimes I listen to one of our local Christian stations (usually 94.5The Fish), or sometimes I listen to some of the Christian contemporary music I have on CD. The last couple of days I have been listening to soundtrack from The Lord of the Rings.

So there is how parts of my day go. Douglas Wilsonâ€™s latest sermons can be downloaded [HERE](http://www.christkirk.com/sermons/RATable.asp)
