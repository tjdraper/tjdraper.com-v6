I am starting to get back into the routine of things now. Though I still feel as if I need to catch up on sleep. I’m posting this from work this morning as the computer digitizes the footage. The insane pace I am trying to keep up makes it hard for me to remember that I need to study God’s word everyday. I am afraid I missed the last couple of days.

Rachel and I have been memorizing the book of James and unfortunately yesterday was the first time we have gone over it in several days. I hope we can get back into the swing of memorization soon.
