Today in church we studied the last chapter of the book of James. We have been going through the book of James for the last couple of weeks. Next week we start on the book of Philippians.

I just purchased a program called Dreamweaver, which is a webesign program, and I have been busy changing the sites that I manage over to that program, and redesigning the sites on the way. This program should make it much easier for me to manage the sites I take care of because it automatically updates the menu in all the pages if I change the template.

This week promises to be busy at work. We have a lot of projects going, and it can be difficult to keep up with them all.
