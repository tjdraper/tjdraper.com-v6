Some of my first memories are of my dad and I out in a semi-truck somewhere in this big US of A. He started taking me with him in the truck when I was three years old. I remember that I loved to be with my dad. And at this place in my life I realize that there could have been nothing better for me. He quit driving when I was about 6 or so to work in a factory for a while, but I was again in the truck with my dad when he went back to truck driving. I was 11 at the time. He continued to be a truck driver until I was 15 and I went with him everywhere. Because I was homeschooled I could take my school work with me. Anything I needed help with from my mom could be done when dad and I got back home. And of course anything that dad could help me with, such as math, he could help me with right there as we were driving down the road (he is still much better at math than I will ever be).

As I said, I feel that this was the best thing that could have happened to me at that age. Children need their father, especially boys. They need an example of a man to follow. For those of us who subscribe to covenant theology, it’s easy to be all talk. When my parents decided that they needed to be raising their children in a more Godly fashion, they didn’t know anything about covenant theology. They read in Proverbs where is says to train up a child in the way he should go… and they knew that they needed to do that. We realize now that the things that we have come to believe over the years are part of something called covenant theology. It’s a big fancy term. Sometimes we can get wrapped up in something, and tell other people that that is what they should be doing, and we forget to do it ourselves. I know of people who can tell you how to raise your children, but you had better look at the fruit of the children that they raised before you take their advice. It’s time for those of the ranks of covenant theology who have been raised that way, to remember why they were raised that way. It’s not just another set of doctrines. We are trying to raise up a Godly seed. And my parents are living proof that you don’t have to know about some big fancy doctrine called covenant theology, you don’t have to know the order of salvation as taught by Calvin (or other great theologians), you don’t have to know what TULIP means, what you need to do is Train up your child.

For those who were not raised with covenant theology, you need to train up your child. To ALL who are reading this who have children. You need to train up your children.

Train them up in what? In the nurture and admonition of the Lord. If you teach your children the scripture, it means that you will have to learn that scripture too (or at least you had better). So if you don’t know the order of salvation when you start training your children, by the time you are done you probably will.

Am I saying that doctrine is not important? NOT BY ANY MEANS. But we must make sure our focus is right. The first thing we have to have is obedience. If you are obedient to the word of God when He tells you train your children (this also falls under that category of making disciples of all nations, by the way), then you are at a good starting place.
