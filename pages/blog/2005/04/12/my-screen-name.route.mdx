I came up with the screen name of Watchful not too long ago, and I really like it. I originally came up with it for the CWS Forum.

The reason I came up with it was because the situation that caused me to join that forum made me feel a bit like a Watchman. Hence the screen name Watchful. Hope you all like my screen name because it has really grown on me.
