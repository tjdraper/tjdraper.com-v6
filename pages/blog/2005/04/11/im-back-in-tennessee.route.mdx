I arrived back in Tennessee yesterday at about 8:30 pm. I had spent the weekend in Illinois with my Fiancée. I brought a couch back to Tennessee with me for our new house in Lyles, TN. So I had my dad meet me there to help me unload the couch. Then I stayed there for the night instead of going back to my parents house (where I am living until we get married) since Lyles is much closer to work and I could sleep later. I needed to get caught up on sleep.

Here are two of the pictures that Rachel’s brother, David, took this weekend.
