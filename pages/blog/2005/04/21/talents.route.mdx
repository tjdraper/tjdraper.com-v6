It’s amazing the way things have changed over the years. When I was growing up, we didn’t have computers and internet. We didn’t have digital cameras and digital cell phones. We didn’t have CDs or DVDs. We didn’t have HD TV or all these fancy plasma screens and LCDs. No email, we wrote letters. No Instant Messaging, we called people.

You know how old I am? I’m 23!!! Things have changed a lot in a short order of time haven’t they? But no matter how much they change, we should endeavor to keep our focus where it should be. The potential that all the above mentioned things have for good can be turned into an equal potential for evil. What are we doing with the things God has given us? Do we use these things to honor and glorify Him?

You know, maybe we aren’t using them for evil necessarily, maybe we just dig a hole and hide them in it? I mean that maybe we are just not doing anything with what God has given to us. We don’t use it for evil, but we aren’t doing anything good with it either. Remember the parable of the talents? Not doing anything with what we have been given is not good. It does not honor and glorify the Lord. In fact, in that parable the servant that didn’t do anything with his talent was called wicked and slothful.

Am I saying that you have to have a blog such as this one in order to be effective? No, of course not. I am not implying that or anything of the sort. But what I am saying is that we need to be careful to **not** let the things God has given us lay idle.
