Well, I’ve been running like I’m headed to a fire all the time. I’m told it only gets busier from here on out. Such is life I guess. I finally had time to update my website with new pictures, and I hope to have time to update the links section soon. I also need to work on my CovenantBeliever.com website sometime soon.

I have today off of work for Memorial Day (I’m actually writing this on Memorial Day, but won’t be able to post this until Tuesday). Rachel was here in Tennessee and brought a lot of stuff with here, so I spent the afternoon organizing a little bit. I’m sure she will want to implement her own organizational scheme after we are married, but for now I try to keep a small semblance of order.
