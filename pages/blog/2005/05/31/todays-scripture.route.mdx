I have a widget on my dashboard (dashboard is a Mac OS 10.4 thing :-D) that displays a daily verse. I am going to try to post it here on the days when I get a chance. Todayâ€™s is:

> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  
> 
> Ephesians 5:1-2 (KJV)
