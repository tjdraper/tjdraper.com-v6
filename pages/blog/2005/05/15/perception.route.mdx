I write this post on this fine Sunday morning from the living room of my fiancée’s house, or rather, her parents house. It will be only 34 more days now until we are to be married. Sometimes, I feel like just a kid who has no business getting married. It’s funny how our perspective changes about things.

Before my parents started homeschooling us children, I went to a private Christian school. I can remember thinking that those high-school kids were huge and so big, and I wanted to be as big as them. Life had to be just cool if you were that tall and big right? Well, here I am at 23 years old, and it doesn’t seem that old to me anymore. In fact, high-school kids seem horribly young and immature. O, and they are much shorter and smaller in general than I seem to recall. I don’t know what happened to them all. I certainly don’t remember growing up. I am not quite sure what happened.

Perception is a funny thing. Peter’s perception of Jesus sure changed by the time he got to the end of Luke Chapter 5. Jesus asked Peter to do something and Peter thought he knew more than Jesus. But to satisfy him, he took a couple of his partners, launched out and lowered the nets. His perception of Jesus changed as soon as he lowered the nets. Amazing isn’t it? Suddenly, Jesus took on a whole new look to Peter.

Our perception of things changes throughout our life. It is a part of life I don’t understand yet, but somehow, I just accept it.
