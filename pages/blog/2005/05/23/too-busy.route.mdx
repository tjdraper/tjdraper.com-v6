I’ve been very busy of late. Between trying to keep up with my work, planning a wedding and the various grasses and weeds of the spring/summer, not to mention my being allergic to almost any kind of pollen. It even seems that I’ve been too busy for God lately. I mean I haven’t done my morning Bible reading very consistently lately. It seems to me that if you are too busy for God, you are just simply too busy. But I don’t know how to slow down either. I was reminded yesterday at Church that the only way to have time for daily devotions is to make time for them. It’s amazing, Rachel and I used to both do our devotions in the morning and then we would email our thoughts about the passage to each other. I loved doing it, and yet I can’t seem to make time for it anymore.

I find it amazing that we can just get so busy we don’t’ have time for God, our creator. I mean, Jesus took time out of his busy schedule to come and die for us, surely we can sacrifice a little bit of time for daily devotions. So, when I get a little bit more consistent in my daily devotions, maybe I can then justify posting here more often… o but that requires time too, which is why I haven’t bee posting here very often in the first place.
