I am writing this on a Word Document from my house, but won’t be able to post this until I get to work because we don’t have internet at the house. We are actually not likely to have internet at the house for a little while because we don’t want to spend the extra money right now.

It’s been pretty insane at work. We had several projects all due pretty much at once. But we have delivered most of them now and only have a couple more left. The pace yesterday was much more tolerable and I was able to start getting the office back in order, which is a good thing because it was becoming a nightmare. None of us had the time to organize it.

Rachel and I have been married a little over three weeks now and we are getting along marvelously… of course you know, I am sure anybody would expect as much at this point. We are really starting to get things in order around the house now. She has a much better eye for decorating than I ever thought about having of course so the house is looking much nicer now. She is quite pleased with the house, except that we have discovered a leak in the roof that we didn’t know about. It leaks in one of the bedrooms that is used for a storage room right now. And since I always kept the door closed I never noticed the leak before. But Rachel found our about it yesterday while it was raining. Hopefully it will be taken care of by the owner of the house since I am still renting it and have not bought it yet.
