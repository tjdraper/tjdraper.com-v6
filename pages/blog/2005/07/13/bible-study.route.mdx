I’m writing this from work as I wait for my computer to export a video file.

Rachel came with me to work this morning so that she could do some shopping around the Franklin area. It certainly beats driving two vehicles all over the place as far as fuel consumption goes. Of course there is the added benefit of high speed wireless internet… and since we don’t have internet at home she likes to come with me sometimes to get on the internet and check email and all kinds of other stuff

We have been trying to keep up with out Bible reading every morning, and this morning we started memorizing out of the book of James again. We had started memorizing the 1st chapter of James about 2 months before we were married, but we sort of slacked off after the wedding. It feels good to be getting back on track.
