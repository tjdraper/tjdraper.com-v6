One funny thing. After I posted my last post, I noticed one of my google adds displayed the text, “FREE WILL, The early church clearly taught free will, not predestination.” I went to the site, and I immediately went to my google adsense console and put that site on my block list. It is supposed to take effect within a couple of hours so hang tight.
