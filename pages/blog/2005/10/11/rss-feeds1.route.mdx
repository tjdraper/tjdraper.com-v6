I have been working on setting up my website with an RSS feed lately and as such have not had a lot of time to post unfortunately. I am pleased to say however, that TJDraper.com now has an RSS feed for whatever it’s worth. It’s actually not as hard to set up as I had feared.

I hope to return to posting about the distinctive marks of reformed theology soon (Haven’t I said that before?).
