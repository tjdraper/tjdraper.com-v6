My wife and I will be leaving for the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival (Otherwise known as SAICFF) on Wednesday. We have been doing a lot of preperation here at the office for it. We have entered a film called A Journey Home, which I have posted a trailer to on [my website](http://www.tjdraper.com). For more information about the SAICFF, go [HERE](http://www.independentchristianfilms.com/).
