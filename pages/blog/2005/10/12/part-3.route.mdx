Distinctive Marks of Reformed Theology
Rev. Marcus J. Serven, Th.M
(part 3 of 14)

The Doctrine of Man & Sin:
All mankind is totally depraved and completely unable to save himself from God’s wrath (Total Inability).  Adam’s sin is immediately imputed to all humanity, so that all are born in original sin.  Most Reformed theologians believe that man was created by God on the sixth day and did not evolve from lower life forms.  Thus, the evolutionary process is rejected as completely spurious.  Each human being is created in the image of God, the Imago Dei, and although this is tarnished at the Fall its distinguishing marks are not removed altogether (Genesis 1:27; Psalm 51:5; Romans 5:12, 6:23).
