Hello all,

I really wanted to get back to posting the wonderful distinctive marks of Reformed Theology, but I just haven’t had the time to get back to it.

I have decided to re-record some of my songs since I now have better recording software and equipment, and more experience. I just finished Great Shepherd and would like to start on another one soon. I have really been inspired lately that I should get an album together and make it available somehow. I don’t know how I would do that exactly though.

Anyway, the new version of Great Shepherd is available to listen to by going to the [Music Page](http://www.tjdraper.com/music.html) of [My Website](http://www.tjdraper.com/). Please send me any feedback, or use the comment link below ![grin](grin.gif).
