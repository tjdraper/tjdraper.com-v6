As you may notice, I’ve made a few changes to this blog. For one, I’ve added an email subscription, which means that if you enter your email address and click the submit button, you will be notified of new posts via email. The email should contain the first 100 letters of the post and then provide a link so you can come straight to that post.

The second is the addition of a counter. The counter is just for the fun of it. I thought it would be interesting anyway.
