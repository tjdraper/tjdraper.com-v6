Distinctive Marks of Reformed Theology
Rev. Marcus J. Serven, Th.M
(part 5 of 14)

The Doctrine of Predestination::
By God’s sovereign decree he predestines the Elect to everlasting life and he damns the Reprobate to everlasting judgement (i.e. Douple Predestination or Supralapsarian).  Some within the Reformed community believe that God predestines the Elect to life, but passes by the others leaving them in their fallen condition (i.e. the doctrine of Preterition or the Infroalapsarian view of the decrees of God).  In either case, the Reprobate ultimately follow their wicked and sinful nature to its destructive end (John 6:37-40, 17:9-11; Romans 9:6-13, 22-24; I Peter 2:7-8).  Thus, Reformed theologians emphasize the sovereign grace of God in salvation and reject the notion that God chooses the Elect on the basis of their good works or their personal decision through the means of Divine Foreknowledge.  The Reformed steadfastly assert that God alone determines who will be the recipients of the gift of salvation (Divine Monergism).  Salvation is not determined by fallen man’s autonomous decision apart from God (Evangelical Arminian theology).
