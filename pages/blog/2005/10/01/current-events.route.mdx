I am going to interrupt my current postings because of an event that has just popped up. For those of you who don’t know what is going on this will be quite a bore, and I don’t intend to clarify the happenings for you.

Recently, I added my comment to a posting (which already had 30 some comments) on another blog I visit at times. For reasons of my own, I am not going to link to it here, but those of you who know what I’m talking about will of course know what I am talking about (and everybody says, “ooookkkkkaaaayyyy.”).

Some of the layout goes like this:

An anonymous commenter posted a comment to a blog, and he posted only scripture references. It was of course obvious what his implications were. But still he posted only scripture, knowing it would provoke a response (I wish the response would have been something like, thank you for the wonderful scripture, but it wasn’t). So when the response came, as it was sure to in this case, he said as much as, “See, I only posted scripture and you reacted. It is the spirit convicting you, your beef is with God.” Many other unkind things were said, and it should be noted that I had my disagreements with all who posted. And then of course I had to add to it my own unkind words to the anonymous poster. While I didn’t always agree with what the original poster of the blog, and some of the regular commenters said, I can’t stand anonymous critics and accusations. And I also didn’t agree with anything he said after he posted his scripture. In my opinion, this anonymous poster was a troublemaker and coming forth in the wrong spirit.

However, my own unkind words were not necessarily justifiable, and I probably should have avoided posting on the matter because there are much bigger battles to face. However, in the issue that arose, if the anonymous poster had any ideas of convincing the blogger and regular commenters that they were wrong, he was going about it in the entirely wrong way. All he managed to do is convince them, myself, and most likely anyone else, that he was a troublemaker looking for a fight. But then, I probably looked like I was looking for a fight also because of my ungracious attitude. I apologize to all for that.

I still do not, however, agree with anonymous mainly because if he had anything to say, he should identify himself and say it like a real human being and not as someone who skulks in the shadows. Skulking in the shadows certainly gives him an advantage. I mean, what if this person were holding a personal grudge against the poster and just wanted to stir something up?

He also made many false assumptions and accusations.

However, it was still unwise of me to post there and I hope I can stay out of these small skirmishes in the future. Again, to those of you who have no clue what I am talking about, I apologize. I hope we can now move on to other subjects.
