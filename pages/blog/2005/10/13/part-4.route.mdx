Distinctive Marks of Reformed Theology
Rev. Marcus J. Serven, Th.M
(part 4 of 14)

The Doctrine of the Law of God::
The Reformed generally believe that the Law of God breaks into three categories: the Moral Law (Ten Commandments) which is eternal, the Ceremonial Law which was completely fulfilled through the sacrificial death of Christ, and the Civil Law which passed away with the end of the nation of Israel.  The Law of God both convicts as individual of sin and is a tutor in leading the sinner to Christ (Galatians 3:24).  The Moral Law has not been abolished by Christ (Matthew 5:17-20).  Instead, it is an eternal standard of righteousness for holy living (Romans 3:31), and a way unto life for every Believer (Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 19).  There are some Reformed theologians who favor a Theonomist view of the Law.  Essentially, a Theonomist would argue that the Law must be seen as a single document and cannot be broken into three categories.  Hence, every aspect of the Law (except that which has been fulfilled by Christ) is relevant and applicable for today.  This theological position has also been known as Christian Reconstruction (Bahnsen, Chilton, DeMar, North, Rushdoony).  A moderating position in regards to the Civil Law extends the principles into the present day, but not the exact particulars.
