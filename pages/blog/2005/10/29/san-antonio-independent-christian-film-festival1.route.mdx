Rachel and I have been having a great time here in San Antonio at the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival. We have been taking turns in the [Franklin Springs Family Media](”http://www.franklinspringsfamilymedia.com”) booth while the other goes, either to hear someone speak or to watch some of the film showings. We are pretty excited about the booth and getting the company name out there. We have had a number of compliments on the film, [“A Journey Home.](http://www.franklinspringsfamilymedia.com/journey.html”)” And several have purchased the film.

However, there have been a couple of disappointments. One that I expected though was a trailer by the Gunn brothers. I had already seen the trailer on Doug’s Blog, but had hoped they would have the good sense to not show it here. But that was not the case. It was a trailer called, “The Monstrous Regiment of Women,” (Rated M for Misogyny). I think that aside from being poorly done, it does serious damage to what we are trying to do here. I say constantly that it is not enough to just point at a problem and/or make fun of it. We can’t just point it out and think that things are going to get better. We can’t run it down and degrade it and just suppose that we are doing our job. We not only point out error, but we represent truth. And I think the latter is the more powerful. And certainly, being proud of the self rating “M” for misogyny, is not what we are trying to represent here. Misogyny means the hatred of Women, and I certainly do not hate women. I do not even think that anyone else here does. I don’t think it is a view we are trying to convey to those who would accuse us either. I would affirm to feminists that I do indeed love my wife and want what is absolutely the best for her. That means that I am the leader of my family and make the final decisions of course, and this alone terrifies the feminists, we do not need to complicate the matter by telling them that we hate women by giving our film an M rating for Misogyny. Believing that the two sexes are equal in quality, but differ in job description, role, and function does not mean that I hate women.

Other disappointments would be things like the quality of acting in a some of the films, the quality control of some (like misspelling of titles and credits), and the message of couple. I do not like the idea that some people get that it is okay for a Christian film to be second rate in quality and the like. We have reason to make it the best it can be, and in this age we have the tools at our disposal less expensive than ever.

But having said all that, we really are enjoying ourselves. As humans we have a tendency to see the bad in things, and I am now going to move on to the good.

I went to a workshop by RC Sproul Jr. yesterday morning and it was great. He always has relevant things to say. He spoke of Worldview and what is relevant and what is not. I also plan to go to his workshop today.

I viewed a video called, “Sam,” that I liked pretty well, and although I generally prefer a movie with a more subtle or integrated type of message, this movies message was right up front. And even though that was the case, I didn’t mind it at all. It is about a young lady whose brother, Sam always told her that all things happen for a reason. But when he died, she stopped believing it. She ultimately found herself on her way to get an abortion at her boyfriend’s request. But on the way she gets a flat tire. Reaching for her cell phone she finds it has a dead battery, or is incapacitated in some similar way. As she looks up in the rearview mirror she sees a small truck has pulled up behind her. Fearing the worst she quickly rolls up the window. Finally, the man knocks on the window and persuades her that only wants to help her. He changes her tire and makes small talk as she listens through a slightly opened window. When she finally asks him what he does, he tells her he just helps people. Most of the time he just does handy work, but sometimes he helps people in “other” ways as well. He then tells her about the dog he took in because the owner was moving and he couldn’t bare to see it just left to die. It was life and he didn’t want to see it suffer. As he tells her this she is having flash backs and the like and is breaking down somewhat. She asks to see the Dog. He brings the dog, and by this time she is out of the car, and she takes it and holds it. As she is petting it she turns back to him to tell him thank you, but he is gone. She looks at the dog’s tag and it’s name is Sam. But the tire on the car is fixed, and now her cell phone is ringing. It was her friend, who was going to the abortion clinic with her. She asks where she has been, and if everything is alright. She responds, “Yes, everything is fine.” Then she turns around and goes back home.

It was really much, much better than it sounds here.

Anyway, I need to sign off now. All in all, we have been enjoying ourselves.
