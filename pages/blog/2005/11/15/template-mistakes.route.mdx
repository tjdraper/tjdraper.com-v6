If there are any of you who read this blog, if you find anything weird with the blog, please comment and let me know. You see, when I changed the template to match my site, I made quite a few HTML mistakes. I keep discovering them and fixing them. Like the mistake I just corrected… It seems that article links weren’t working. I corrected that mistake. I am really trying to learn this HTML stuff. It is frustrating sometimes, but I think I am getting there.
