Here is a few of my comments on Scott Brown’s – The Sufficiency of Scripture from the Uniting Church and Family conference.

Scott affirmed the doctrine of Sola-Scriptura which is a very good thing. It’s not God’s word plus something, God’s word is sufficient. He said his wife liked to say that the Word of God is like water, it is totally sufficient. You can try coke and tea and all kinds of other drinks, but water is sufficient and necessary. As opposed to the Roman Catholic doctrine of scripture plus tradition. And I would add that tradition is not bad if it is biblical tradition. Tradition is defined as the transmission of customs or beliefs from generation to generation. That is good and healthy as long as it is biblical.

I would also like to add that generally drinking other things besides water is not bad, but you must have the proper water intake. And I think it is the same with scripture. You need scripture, you don’t need anything else. But there are other things that are good for your spiritual health. It’s not wrong to read works published by someone else, and can be very beneficial to your spiritual health, but you must have the intake of scripture.

He also mentioned that most churches are moving away from the practice of reading the scripture. One Pastor he talked to said he has started showing movie clips in place of the reading of scripture because people would start to zone out while he was reading the word.

I think that is pretty amazing and an indicator of the church, a thermometer if you will, and the church has the signs of a sickness. It’s a famine for the word of the Lord.

I think Scott did a fair job with this subject, though it felt like he wandered off topic too often and chased rabbits. He didn’t really say much that I disagreed with, at least not worth noting except for a statement that didn’t really seem to do with anything else. He said that Family integrated churches are not cultic. My issue with that statement is that it is a blanket statement. I think that many, many are not. I am a part of one that is not. But I feel that there are others that are. They idolize the family over God and it becomes their God. This is cultic, it’s the cult of the family.

But that is the only one worth noting, and it’s mostly something that I wouldn’t want someone to take the wrong way.
