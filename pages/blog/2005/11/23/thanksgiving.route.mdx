I hope all my readers (all 2 of them… haha) have a wonderful thanksgiving. We rejoice in this special day when we can remember what the Pilgrims went through and the fact that they were so thankful.

The Pilgrims were thankful to be alive. They certainly didn’t have a lot of food to be thankful for as is often believed. At that first thanksgiving, each plate had only 5 kernels of corn and yet they were so thankful to God. I think we could learn a thing or two from the Pilgrims.
