Here are some pictures from the NCFIC conference finally (I took my time about getting them up here, but I’m going to use Thanksgiving as an excuse).

This is the entrance to the conference room in between workshops.

This is the sign to the room we were in at the Marriott in Birmingham for the conference.

It took more than one Mountain Dew to make it through the weekend.

But Boaz didn’t even try to make it through the weekend without a nap or two.

Notice that the Drapers account for the largest portion of people at this table!

This is one cute group of girls!!! All except the one on the far right is from our Church. I think we should have had the conference in Nashville, there were a lot of people from Nashville.
