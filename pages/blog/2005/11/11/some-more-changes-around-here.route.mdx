As you may have noticed by now, there are some more changes with my blog. I took the time this morning on the drive in to Franklin (Rachel was driving the car) to modify my blogger template so that it actually fit with my website. It has the same navigation buttons and stuff now. You will also notice the RSS buttons for both my blog and the Home Page of my site. RSS is a wonderful thing for those of you who don’t yet know what it is. It’s a live feed that you bookmark in your RSS reader, and it will automatically download new articles and notify you that there are new articles available.

Have fun… will post some more stuff soon, and hopefully it will be inetersting next time.
