We had a great time at the regional Uniting Church and Family conference in Alabama. The topics were:

• The Sufficiency of Scripture – Scott Brown  
• Why the Church Needs the Family and the Family Needs the Church – Jeff Pollard  
• The Family is the Factory of Church Leadership – Scott Brown  
• The Father’s Role in Family Worship – Jeff Pollard  
• Establishing Biblical Church Government – Jason Dohm  
• If, When, and How We Leave a Church – Don Hart, Esq.  
• The Father’s Administration of Christ’s Kingdom in the Home – Jeff Pollard  
• How Do You Train Children to Stay in the Worship Service – Scott Brown  
• Panel Discussion  
• Building God-Centered, Word Centered, Christ-Exalting, Family Integrated Churches – Scott Brown.

I hope to have comments and general stuff coming on most (okay okay, maybe only some) of these topics soon, including what I liked and didn’t like. I’m not going to just lavish the praise heavily and skip anything I disagreed with. I also should have a few pictures up soon from the conference.
