I’ll be getting off of work early today to go to Lobelville and move the last of my stuff out of mom and dad’s old place. They have pretty much moved into the new house even though it is not yet finished. They were mudding and painting drywall last I knew.

I don’t even know what all I have left at Lobeville for sure. Among other things there is a welder that dad would like to keep at his place for a while, but he needs help moving it to the new place. I know I have a lot of mag motorcycle wheels lying around the shop from my buggy building days. I don’t know if I have ever mentioned that on my blog. I used to build buggies (the kind that horses pull). I didn’t build a too many. I think I actually built maybe 8 to 10 or so. I also built other horse drawn equipment like fore carts. That is basically an Amish tractor. You hook too horses to it, and you can pull trailers and just about anything else with it. Ah, my past life. Working in film is so much different.

I am looking forward to going to the regional NCFIC conference in Alabama next weekend, although I didn’t recognize any of the speakers, it is put on by the Vision Forum.

Most of what I have been doing at work lately is mixing the audio for The Peasall Sisters live concert. It is for the DVD we are working feverishly on. We are very near completion now and should be releasing it shortly. We have already started taking orders for it on our [website.](http://www.franklinspringsfamilymedia.com/) I’m sure I sound like a broken record, but I am really excited about being able to work for a family oriented company.
