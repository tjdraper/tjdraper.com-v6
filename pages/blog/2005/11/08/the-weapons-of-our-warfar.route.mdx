The dust has settled just a little bit. We did survive the Film Festival and the drive back home, and I am still not caught up on sleep… so everything is back to normal.

We did have an awesome time at the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival. There is real promise from the Christian filmmakers that were assembled there. You know, film is an area of our culture that has too long been dominated by the enemy of our God. The purpose of the SAICFF is to conquer that realm of Godlessness. We believe it is part of the dominion mandate God has given us. We also believe it is our job to impact the culture in a positive way. To be salt and light is our God given calling. The medium of film is an incredible means by which we can be an impact on the culture around us. Now more than ever are there tools (and cheaper than ever before) to accomplish the conquering of the film arena.

I went to a couple of RC Sproul Jr.’s seminars, and one of them was titled, “The Weapons of our Warfare.” The elements that make up our weapons are truth, beauty, and goodness. Particularly truth though. The reason for this is that our enemy really has none at all. What a powerful weapon. To illustrate, he told a story of when he was in college. He fought the good fight for the “theory” of objective truth in a world that says we make our own truth. “There is no objective truth,” the world says. And so RC was out to prove that there was. He was quite outspoken about it too. Then one day the dean of the school called him to his office. The dean told him he had no complaint with his studies, he had very good grades. No, rather his problem was that he was arguing with the teachers that there was objective truth. “It’s okay for you to believe that,” the dean told him, “just don’t be so vocal about,” he said. So RC couldn’t help himself, and he said, “I think I understand you sir, what you are saying is that you want me to not be quite so vocal about my view that there is objective truth?” The Dean replied, “Yes, that is it exactly.” So RC said, “Well let me make sure I am understanding you just so that there can be no mistake, you are saying that it is wrong for me to be so outspoken about my view that there is objective truth?” “Well yes,” replies the Dean, “That is exactly what I am saying.” Since he still did not get it, RC had to help him just a bit more. He said, “So sir, you are saying that the objective truth is that it is WRONG for me to say that there is objective truth?” The Dean simply lowered his head a couple of notches and said, “You may go now, Mr. Sproul.”

You see, how could the dean tell RC that the objective truth was that it was wrong for him to propagate the view that there is objective truth when there is not supposed to be any objective truth? After all, we make our own truth.

My point is that we, as believers, DO have the corner on truth. We have a powerful weapon in our arsenal that is truth, and it is particularly powerful because our enemy has NONE. Sure, sometimes our enemy mixes a little lie with a lot of truth, but we know that a partial truth is a lie. So our enemy has no truth. When we confront the enemy with truth he has no defense for it. And we must be merciless with the truth.
