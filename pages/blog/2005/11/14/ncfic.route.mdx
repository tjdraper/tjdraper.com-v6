Our entire church family will be traveling to the regional [NCFIC](http://www.visionforumministries.org/sections/events/ncfic/details.asp?conf=al) conference this weekend. I will be working a half day on Friday and then traveling in caravan with my mom and dad’s family. Between our Ford Escort and their Chevy Lumina we have enough seats for the 11 of us, and that means that they don’t have to take one of their trucks which consumes fuel at an alarming rate during this time of high fuel prices, nor do they have to use my sisters untrustworthy car which usually won’t start after the engine has warmed up (sounds like a starter or starter solenoid needs replaced to me). We are looking forward to see what sort of good teaching we will be hearing down there.
