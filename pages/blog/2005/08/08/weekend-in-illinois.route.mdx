I went up to see my Grandma in the nursing home last weekend. We left Friday afternoon (I was able to get the afternoon off of work) at 3:00 from my dad’s place in Lobelville. It was Dad, Elise, Levi, Rachel and myself in dad’s car. The trip wasn’t too bad for me at least because I brought my laptop with me and worked on the re-designing of my website that I had started a couple of days ago. It’s amazing how much time that sort of thing takes. I spent hours in Photoshop and Dreamweaver. And it’s not a complicated site by any means. I can see how web design would be a full time job. But I’m getting side tracked.

My Grandma fell 2 weeks ago sometime during the night and broke some bones in her face. She then went to the hospital for a couple of days, and is now in a nursing home for rehabilitation. She DOES NOT want to be there, and that is one of the reasons we went up to see her. She needs a lot of love from all of us right now. It’s sad because she is completely with it, but has a hard time talking. Anyway, those of you who read my blog, please pray for her.

Also, Rachel and I went to visit her Grandma Price in the nursing home in Pekin, IL. She seemed to be doing okay for the most part, though she had lost her glasses. But she had found them again by Sunday so she was in a better mood then.

Okay, so I don’t have much more to say, but I just felt like I needed to post something on my blog. Seems I am too busy to post on it very much.
