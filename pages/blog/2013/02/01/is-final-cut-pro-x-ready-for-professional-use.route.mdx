> The Final Cut Pro X launch was not one of Apple’s best. In the launch, Apple introduced Final Cut Pro X, and killed the entire Final Cut Studio suite and Final Cut Server.
>
> Normally, when new versions come out, old versions die. But, in this case, there were three missing elements:
>
> -   FCP X could not read FCP 7 files, so there was no upgrade path for current FCP 7 projects
> -   There was not feature parity between FCP X and FCP 7
> -   Not all the software in Final Cut Studio was replaced, Soundtrack Pro, DVD Studio Pro, and Color were gone.
>
> The reaction was swift, bitter, and emotional; and instantly colored everyone’s perception of Final Cut Pro X.
>
> So, in thinking about Final Cut Pro X today, you need to separate in your mind your reactions to the launch from your perception of the product.
>
> Personally, I think the launch was terrible, but that FCP X is quite good.

> Well, you can believe that if you want, in the same way that a Ferrari is simply a super-charged VW Beetle. They both have four wheels and an engine, but the results are totally different.
>
> Just as you can not say that since a Ferrari and a Bug are both cars, therefore they must do the same thing, you can not say that because iMovie and Final Cut look similar, they must BE similar.

Has anyone who says this actually, you know, **used** iMovie? I have — or rather, I have tried. The two should not be confused. iMovie is very difficult to use for anything and frankly I don't even know how consumers get along with it. Final Cut X, while different and hard to use **if you are used to FCP 7**, is not that hard to get along with.

Anyway, listen to the man, he has been _the_ voice of reason throughout this whole process. And this one is a good read.
