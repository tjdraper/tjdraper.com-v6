> Following reports that [an untethered jailbreak was finally set to be made available for iOS 6.1 users on Monday](http://bgr.com/2013/02/04/ios-6-1-jailbreak-release-date-315664/), the Evad3rs Jailbreak Team has made their jailbreak tool evasi0n available for download. The tool jailbreaks [Appleâ€™s](http://bgr.com/tag/apple) ([AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL)) [iPhone 5](http://bgr.com/tag/iphone-5), iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, [iPad mini](http://bgr.com/tag/ipad-mini), all iPad models and third-, fourth- and fifth-generation iPod touch models running iOS 6.0 or iOS 6.1.

Wait, is jailbreaking still a thing? I really could not possibly care any less about this.
