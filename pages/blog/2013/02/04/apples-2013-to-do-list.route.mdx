> I didn’t just lead Apple to a [record quarterly profit](http://www.macworld.com/article/2026112/iphone-ipad-sales-up-macs-fall-as-apple-sees-record-sales.html) of $13.1 billion on sales of $54.5 billion, so I don’t expect to be consulted. But were [Tim](http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/tim-cook.html) to ask me, here’s what I would tell him Apple should do in 2013—in broad strokes, and in no particular order. (We’ve got people to work out the details—right, Tim?) This is not a fantasy wish list. These are things I think Apple can and should do this year. This list is not exhaustive.

It's Siracusa, so as usually, it's good stuff, even if I don’t agree with everything. Such as bullet 3: Diversify the iPhone product line. I don't see at all that Apple needs to do this. Also, the point Make Messages work correctly. Am I the only one that doesn't have any trouble with Messages (hint: I'm not). It feels like John has just jumped on the bandwagon for that one. Message works just fine. I never have any trouble with it. In fact, I love Messages/iMessage a lot!

Everything else seems great!
