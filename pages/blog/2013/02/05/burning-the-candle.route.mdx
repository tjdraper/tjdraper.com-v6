> Currently, I’m under the gun with some pretty big pressures at work. So much so, that _512_ has been collecting dust for a couple of weeks. It’s frustrating being so busy I don’t have time to read what’s clogging up my RSS and Instapaper accounts or write what’s bouncing around my head. I have to remember that my day job pays the bills, not this, so if things are little quiet for the coming weeks, please forgive me.

I'm only posting this because, man do I know the feeling!
