> Go Daddy, a Super Bowl advertiser for the past nine years, ran two ads during the game, including "[Perfect Match](http://mashable.com/2013/02/01/bar-refaeli-makes-out-with-nerdy-guy-in-go-daddy-super-bowl-ad/)," which featured supermodel Bar Refaeli making out with a nerdy-looking guy and "[YourBigIdea.co](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=aE6ugHoIB_Q)," which showed entrepreneurs across the world coming up with ideas though only one acts fast and secures a .co domain name.

What is wrong with people! I've already tried to minimize my business with that tasteless and horrible company. Their "Perfect Match" ad just made me want to go out and anti-evangelize GoDaddy. My word what is wrong with people?
