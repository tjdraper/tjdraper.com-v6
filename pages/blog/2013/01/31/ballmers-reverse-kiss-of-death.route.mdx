> It’s too bad that [Dropbox](http://bgr.com/tag/dropbox/) isn’t a publicly traded company, because it would be a great time to buy its shares now that [Microsoft](http://bgr.com/tag/microsoft) ([MSFT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=msft)) CEO Steve Ballmer has given it his [patented reverse-kiss-of-death](http://bgr.com/2012/11/15/ballmer-interview-2012-android-ios/). Ballmer, who [previously predicted the iPhone would flop because it lacked a physical keyboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U) and that [Android would fail because Google wasn’t slapping OEMs with any licensing fees](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10083590-94.html) to use it, [told _BusinessWeek_](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-29/microsofts-steve-ballmer-does-not-fear-dropbox-or-an-office-less-ipad) on Tuesday that the cloud storage company was just a “little startup” that posed no threat to Microsoft’s own SkyDrive cloud service.

Man, how do I get a piece of Dropbox?!?
