Yep, I'm still here. I've been focusing a lot of my energy on [MovieByte](http://moviebyte.com). And when I'm not doing that, I'm trying to actually, you know, make money. But I really want to make something of this site so with the new year I'm going to try to start posting again. I will try to post at least a couple of Linked List items on weekdays, though given everything going on I may miss a day here and there.

It's a new year with new opportunities and I'm excited for what's ahead! And who knows what Apple is going to do this year, it could be fun to talk about!

You will notice in the sidebar I have updated the podcasts. That's all the podcasts I am personally in, I recommend you listen and subscribe (of course).
