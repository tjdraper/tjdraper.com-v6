> Podcasts are all kinds of awesome. A Prairie Home Companion, This American Life, Wiretap, The Truth -- there's a virtually endless supply of great listening to be had free of charge.

> [Apple's Podcasts app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8), on the other hand, is all kinds of suck. It's so abysmal that I'm breaking my if-you-can't-say-anything-nice rule to vent my hatred of it. Ever since it debuted last June, I've tried to put up with it, tried to work around its countless limitations and atrocious interface. But no more. I'm done.

You know, [I don't disagree](/article/2012/06/podcasts). Things like this really do make me concerned about Apple. They don't seem to have shown any signs of repentance about this truly terrible app.
