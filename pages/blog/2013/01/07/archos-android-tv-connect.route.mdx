> Archos is aiming to solve those conundrums with its new TV Connect, an Android computer, complete with HD camera and a handheld remote with a pair pointer sticks used to simulate a multitouch screen. Under the hood is a 1.5GHz "multi core" CPU, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable storage. For networking you can go old school and plug in an Ethernet line or lose the cables and rely on WiFi. The remote has more control options than you could possibly desire crammed in a form factor that's more than a little reminiscent of a certain [failed Atari console](http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/22/portable-jaguar-modder-gives-ben-heck-a-run-for-his-compact-gami/). In addition to the pair of pointer sticks, there's a full QWERTY keypad, a directional pad, four game buttons, the standard Android keys and volume controls -- not to mention you can move an onscreen cursor simply by pointing the remote at your TV.

Oh yeah, that's exactly the sort of thing I wanted to fiddle with for my TV. Yeah, that will have a place in my home right awa... hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.

I mean, I donâ€™t know what's worse, the crazy blackberry keyboard/game console controller-remote, or that nasty bar hanging over the top of the TV.
