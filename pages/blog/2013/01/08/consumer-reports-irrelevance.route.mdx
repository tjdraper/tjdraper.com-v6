> The February issue of Consumer Reports will include the graphic above, [clipped by _Business Insider_](http://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-reports-iphone-5-2013-1), that ranks numerous Android devices above the [iPhone 5](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=iphone+5) in its “What’s Hot” February 2013 list. On every carrier, the Samsung Galaxy S3 ranks higher than the [iPhone 5](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=iphone+5). Even the LG Optimus G and the Droid RAZRs top the iPhone on various carriers.

Consumer Reports: Continuing their trend of irrelevance into 2013 and beyond. Meanwhile, Apple continues to sell the most popular and best selling and second best selling smartphones.

I think someone in power over there at Consumer Reports has a chip on their shoulder about Apple products.
