Don Melton has been posting some stuff about his time working on Safari and it's awesome stuff. While I think Firefox and the Gecko layout engine sort of jumpstarted the browser revolution, Safari is still, despite some of it's flaws, my current daily driver. My fall back browser is Chrome, which is also based on Safari's WebKit rendering engine. Firefox is a very VERY distant third at this point. I also really enjoyed going back and watching Steve introduce Safari to the world in the [Macworld 2003 Keynote](http://donmelton.com/2013/01/07/macworld-2003-keynote/). This was the beginning of Apple's heyday.
