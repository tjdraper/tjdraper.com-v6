Awesome! I want this on my next iPhone... not that I've had any problems with breaking glass on any iPhones I've had so far, but there can't be anything wrong with even stronger glass.

I do have one question, when can we have this in our cars? It seems I am constantly getting cracked windshields due to flying rocks and the like. It's really annoying!
