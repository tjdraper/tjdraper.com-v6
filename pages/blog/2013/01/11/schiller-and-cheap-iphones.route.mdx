I'm not a fan of theory that Apple is going to produce another, less expensive iPhone. I believe their strategy of selling last years iPhone at a bargain, and the 2 year old iPhone free on contract is a really great one. That said, I would like to pont out that he said “cheap” smartphones will never be the future of Apple products. He did not say “inexpensive”. They are never going to make cheap junk, that's just not Apple.
