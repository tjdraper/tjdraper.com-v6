> Walmart and [Straight Talk](http://www.straighttalk.com/) Wireless are [now carrying the iPhone 5](http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/2013/01/08/walmart-straight-talk-to-offer-the-iphone-on-its-45-no-contract-unlimited-plan), offering a $45 unlimited talk, text and data plan with no contract. It was [previously reported](http://www.thatsitguys.com/news/straight-talk-to-carry-the-iphone-4-iphone-5#) by _That's It Guys_. Straight Talk is a subsidiary of TracFone, and its iPhone customers will use AT&T's network. There is no indication of whether the phones will support AT&T's LTE network or not.

> Like other prepaid plans such as Virgin Mobile, users must pay full price for their iPhones without having them subsidized by the carrier. Unlike Virgin Mobile, Walmart is offering holders of the Walmart credit card a no-interest fixed payment plan for $25/month. This allows customers to have a unlimited talk, text and data plan for a total of $70/month before taxes and fees.

I am seriously thinking about switching to Straight Talk when my contract is up if I can stomach putting up with AT&T's network a while longer. It's less expensive, and I'm already only with AT&T because it's less expensive for me than Verizon. If that wasn't the case, I would be with Verizon in a heartbeat.
