Jacqui Cheng has a nice gallery of pictures showing the evolution of SoundJam MP iTunes.

Apple purchased SoundJam in the year 2000, and thus iTunes was born. Looking at those screen shots of SoundJam, I wonder if this was the first, or one of the first interfaces to sport Brushed Metal before it was cool pervasive. I honestly don't know where Brushed Metal started for sure, but this is certainly the oldest app I have seen to sport Brushed Metal.
