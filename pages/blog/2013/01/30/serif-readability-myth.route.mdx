Yes, this is me linking to a link post, and I certainly encourage you to [read the post](http://asserttrue.blogspot.se/2013/01/the-serif-readability-myth.html) Marco also linked to, but what Marco had to say is what I'm interested in.

> In my anecdotal experimentation, serifs are more readable in some contexts, and sans-serifs are more readable in others. I like Lyon Text (serif) on Retina iPad, Elena (serif) on iPad Mini, and Ideal Sans on iPhone. I don’t like dark backgrounds with light text anywhere except on iPhone, and only with sans-serifs.

Personally though, I don't like dark backgrounds with light text in any regular reading context — not on my iPhone, not on my computer, not on paper (obviously) not anywhere. It hurts my eyes something terrible when reading for more than a few seconds.
