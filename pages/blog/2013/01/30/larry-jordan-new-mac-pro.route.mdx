This!

This is exactly right. What does Apple expect it’s iOS developers to use? Sure they can and do use iMacs and MacBook Pros, but many want and need professional towers — Mac Pros.

I've said it before and I will say it again: for me as a professional, the Mac is the Apple product I use the most, and not just by a little bit. Because I am a creative professional using Macs, all of my household runs on all sorts of Apple products. My TV is powered by the Apple TV, my wife has a MacBook, my WiFi router is an Apple AirPort, we both have iPhones. And my immediate family has a nontrivial amount of Apple hardware. My mom has an iMac, my dad has a MacBook Pro, my sister has a MacBook Pro, several members of my family have a varying amount of iPods and iPod Touches (iPods Touch?). This can loosely be related to the fact that I as a creative professional use Apple products and recommend them to others and actively encourage others to get Apple products. If Apple stops serving my needs and I am forced to use other computing solutions, the halo effect goes away. Apple has a lot of consumer traction and it would be hard for them to fail completely — to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as it were — but should Apple start getting really stupid about serving the professionals, in many ways the market drivers, then I think we will see a slow erosion of everything Apple has built.

Side note: whatever Apple does with the Mac Pro or it's successor, I _really_ hope they move away from the sharp-edged cheese grater look and feel.
