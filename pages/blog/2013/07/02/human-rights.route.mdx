Keep in mind that this Kirsten is a liberal columnist. It gives me hope that not everyone on the left is insane.

> “Get ready for pat-a-cake! Baby’s hands are now fully developed and he spends most of his awake time groping around in the darkness of your uterus. Brain and nerve endings are developed enough now so that your baby can feel the sensation of touch.” Let’s be clear: Davis has been called a hero for trying to block a bill that would make aborting this baby illegal.

How is it heroic to champion a so-called right of someone to kill another? And what's more, that other person **has no voice**.

> In addition to the limit on late-term abortions, the Texas legislature sought to pass regulations on abortion clinics similar to what was passed in Pennsylvania in 2011 after the [Gosnell horror](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/16/yes-there-is-a-gosnell-trial-coverup-by-the-big-news-organizations.html).

You know, the Gosnell horror the pro-choicers were trying to say did not represent them and what they believe.

> So no, I don’t stand with Wendy. Nor do most women, as it turns out. According to a [June _National Journal_ poll](http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressional-connection/coverage/americans-narrowly-support-20-week-abortion-ban-20130626), 50 percent of women support, and 43 percent oppose, a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, except in cases of rape and incest.

> One can assume I am also not the only woman in America who is really tiring of the Wendys of the world claiming to represent “women’s rights” in their quest to mainstream a medical procedure—elective late-term abortion—that most of the civilized world finds barbaric and abhorrent. In many European countries, you can’t get an abortion past 12 weeks, except in narrow circumstances. [Gallup reported in January](http://www.gallup.com/poll/160058/majority-americans-support-roe-wade-decision.aspx) that 80 percent of Americans think abortion should be illegal in the third trimester, and 64 percent think it should be illegal in the second trimester.

> Human-rights movements have traditionally existed to help the voiceless and those without agency gain progressively more rights. Yet in the case of abortion, the voiceless have progressively lost rights at the hands of people who claim to be human-rights crusaders. Abortion-rights leaders have [turned the world upside down](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/06/abortion-rights-community-has-become-the-nra-of-the-left.html). They want us to believe that a grown woman is voiceless, that she has less agency than the infant in her womb who relies on her for life.

Precisely! I could not agree more whole-heartedly with this.

Also recommended reading is her article titled, "[Abortion Rights Community Has Become the NRA of the Left](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/06/abortion-rights-community-has-become-the-nra-of-the-left.html)."
