Allen is almost 2 1/2 months old. He is getting so big it is hard to believe. After his check-up tomorrow, I’m hoping to post exactly how big he is. He is interracting much more with us, giving us the cutest smiles. Unfortunately, I’m having a hard time getting pictures of his smile. Here is a close one.
