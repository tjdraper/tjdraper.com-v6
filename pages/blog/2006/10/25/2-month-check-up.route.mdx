Allen had his two month check-up yesterday. The Dr. was very pleased with his growth. He now weighs 12 lbs. 3 1/2 oz. and is 22 3/4 in. long. He is in about the 50th percentile for his age. That is up from his 2 week check-up when he was in around the 25th percentile. He had to have his 2 month shots and it ruined his day. Three shots and a sticky oral vaccine to take is enough to ruin anybody’s day. He slept for several hours after the Dr.‘s visit, but after he woke up and ate, nothing could calm him down. Unfortunately, it was my day for running errands and we were in Dickson. So I cut them short and took him home. He got his first taste of baby Tylenol. Thankfully, that seemed to help and he was able to go to sleep. After that nap, he felt a little better and gave us a hesitating smile. But that is about all we got out of him that day. Thankfully, he is feeling much better this morning and is back to his old self.

He has found his thumb, much to his father’s dismay. I have noticed though that he mostly only sucks it when he wants me, but is left to himself. If I pick him up then he usually stops.

He is paying much more attention to what is going on. This morning I dug a toy out of the pile of stuff in the crib for him. It really got his attention and he enjoyed looking at it and listening to the music. Look at him lift his head up!!!
