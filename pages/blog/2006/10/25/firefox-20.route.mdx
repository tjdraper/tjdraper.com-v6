Firefox 2.0 was released yesterday and may be downloaded [here](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/).

I have installed this version on my Mac Laptop, my G5 edit station at work, and my stupid Windows PC at home and on all 3 computers, it seems faster, snappier and in general is an even better browsing experience than it already was. There are some nice new features too, like putting tab closing buttons on the individual tabs like Apple’s Safari has had for years, and better built in RSS and feed reading support. Since I use Google reader for my RSS and feed reading, Firefox’s new integration with Google reader is nice. You can set it up in preferences to use Google reader to subscribe to a feed when you click the little RSS icon. AWESOME!

Let’s see, what else… O yes, the big one, and one of the reasons I loved Apple’s Safari, Firefox now has inline spell checking. Which makes it nicer to post on this blog for instance, because it will underline misspelled words in red just like a word processor.

Firefox 2.0 also feels much more refined. So far, I highly recommend the upgrade.
