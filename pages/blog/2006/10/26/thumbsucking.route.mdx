I mentioned in a previous post that Allen had found his thumb. Technically that is not quite true. I found him with his thumb in his mouth when he was only a couple days old. This led me to suspect that he had been sucking it in-utero and we would have problems with it later. However, as he didn’t have enough motor control to find it consistently thereafter, merely putting his whole fist in his mouth, I put it out of my mind. But last week he started sucking his thumb quite regularly.

We would very much like to get him to stop before he forms a habit as we don’t want it to cause orthodontic problems later on. This evening we tried a mitten on his hand. You can see how well that worked.

If anyone has any suggestions we would be glad to hear them.
