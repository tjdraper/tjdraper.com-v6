Okay, I simply have not had the time to keep up with everything, so I have simplified this website. As you can see, this blog is now the main drive of this site and there are only a couple other pages. Also, Rachel has decided to quit keeping up her own blog and starting posting on my blog here when she feels the urge to blog. Stay tuned as we try to find time to post some stuff.

Also, a special thanks to [Mark Stubblefield](http://www.mstub.com/blog/) and [David Price](http://dpricejr.blogspot.com/) for their opinions in the new design and layout of this site. Some of their opinions I took, some of them I didnâ€™t, but this is a better design for their input. Thanks a bunch guys!
