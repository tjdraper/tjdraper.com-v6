I am leaving Kerrville Texas this morning and headed to Ft. Worth. I will be taking a detour this morning however to go to Boerne Christian Assembly for Church.

In Ft. Worth we will be filming a live concert at Bass Hall which should be a lot of fun. We will be using 4 Varicams and one Panasonic HVX200. The 200 does not shoot on tape, instead it uses cards called P2 cards, which fits in a PC-MCIA slot of a Powerbook or most PC laptops. It will be my responsibility to co-ordinate the offloading of media from the cards.
