And have been for a week. I’m sorry I haven’t posted sooner. We are still processing all of the footage we shot and digitizing the footage from the Varicam’s tapes. It’s been a really busy week.

In the evenings I have been editing the [City on a Hill](http://www.tjdraper.com/film.html) conference so I usually don’t get to bed until about 11:00 pm or so. I’ll try to find time to post something of worth before too much longer.
