As I mentioned in a post previous, I had the privilege to attend Boerne Christian Assembly while I was in Texas. It was a rather enjoyable time as I had the chance to speak with [Isaac Botkin](http://www.outside-hollywood.com/) after the service, and during the fellowship meal. He had many interesting things to share, and I quite enjoyed my conversation with him. Unfortunately I’m not necessarily much of a conversationalist, and as some of you may know, sometimes the only thing I can talk about is Macs and how much better they are than Windoze PCs. I’m afraid I may have overdone it with Isaac and conveyed the wrong idea to him… but after all, he uses PCs when he should be using Macs, and I told him that the Lord could save him from such delusion ![wink](wink.gif). In all seriousness it was a very pleasant time.

My boss, director and owner of [Franklin Springs Family Media](http://www.franklinsprings.com/), was also able to spend some time with [Doug Phillips](http://www.visionforum.com/hottopics/blogs/dwp/), and Doug even posted about us on his blog [HERE](http://www.visionforum.com/hottopics/blogs/dwp/?archive=/2006_04_01_index.htm#114528419129402675). I look forward to being able to spend more time with the brethren from Boerne Christian Assembly.
