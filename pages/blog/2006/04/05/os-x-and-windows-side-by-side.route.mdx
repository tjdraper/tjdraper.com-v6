I’ve gotta tell you this is exciting stuff, except of course that Windoze™ is involved at all, but Windows is with us to stay for a while and Apple is all about making life easier. So they have [provided the means](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/) to run Windows XP natively on their Intel based systems. This is to smooth the transition from PC to Macintosh. It will assuage user’s fears of the Mac because now they can fall back on Windows and still have the beauty, elegance, and superior hardware of the Mac. So if you want to test drive OS X on your next computer and still have Windows there to make you feel better, Apple has made it possible for you. And those of us who use Macs already know what happens when you try OS X for more than 5 minutes… You are hooked!! OS X is simply the best, most stable, and easiest to use platform on the market. This is of course not to say that OS X doesn’t have it’s flaws, but it’s still the best choice by far!

Very exciting stuff!
