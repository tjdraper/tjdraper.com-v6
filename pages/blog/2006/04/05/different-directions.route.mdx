I am writing this from Texas, where I’ll be for almost two weeks on two productions of the company I work for. I will return to my beloved wife next Thursday.

Rachel is actually away right now in Peoria for her sister’s recital which was this past Saturday and will be returning to Tennessee Wednesday. Of course she will be returning to an empty house. I already miss her a lot!
