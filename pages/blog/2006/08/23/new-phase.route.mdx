It is a new phase in my life and I don’t know how much I will be able to post anymore, but I will try. I go back to work full time tomorrow so it should promise to be hectic. I have quite a bit of stuff on my plate and they are as follows:

1.  Spend time with wife and baby
2.  Spend time with wife and baby
3.  Spend more time with wife and baby

Well, I think you get the point. Anyway I intend to make that little guy a high priority. He is after all the cutest, most adorable baby I have ever seen!

I also have other stuff going on, like a couple of trips to Peoria coming up. One will be for Allen’s baptism at a still undetermined time. Also, [Providence Church](http://www.providencepeoria.org/) has a [Family Reformation Conference with James McDonald](http://www.providencepeoria.org/lecture_series/reformation.htm) coming up September 29 through October 1 that I am heavily involved in planning (head on over there and register!). I will also be doing the graphical design for the bulletins, as well as filming and editing the entire thing.

Then we will be traveling to San Antonio for the Film Festival held on October 19, 20, and 21.

Busy times, busy times!
