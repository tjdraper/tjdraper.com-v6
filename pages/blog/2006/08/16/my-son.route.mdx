Today, August 16, 2006, at 12:28pm, a 6 lbs. 12 oz. 19 1/2 inch long miracle was born to me and Rachel. We have named him Timmothy Allen Draper III, and will call him Allen. Everything appears normal and healthy, Rachel is feeling quite well actually considering a semi long labor, and Allen is nursing away without any difficulties! Praise God for such a miracle. May he grant us the grace to raise him in the nurture and admonition of the Lord!
