One day a 6 year old girl was sitting in a classroom. The teacher was going to explain evolution to the children. The teacher asked a little boy: Tommy do you see the tree outside?  
TOMMY: Yes.  
TEACHER: Tommy, do you see the grass outside?  
TOMMY: Yes.  
TEACHER: Go outside and look up and see if you can see the sky.  
TOMMY: Okay. (He returned a few minutes later) Yes, I saw the sky.  
TEACHER: Did you see God up there?  
TOMMY: No.  
TEACHER: That’s my point. We can’t see God because he isn’t there. Possibly he just doesn’t exist.

A little girl spoke up and wanted to ask the boy some questions.  
The teacher agreed and the little girl asked the boy: Tommy, do you see the tree outside?  
TOMMY: Yes.  
LITTLE GIRL: Tommy do you see the grass outside?  
TOMMY: Yessssss!  
LITTLE GIRL: Did you see the sky?  
TOMMY: Yessssss!  
LITTLE GIRL: Tommy, do you see the teacher?  
TOMMY: Yes  
LITTLE GIRL: Do you see her brain?  
TOMMY: No  
LITTLE GIRL: Then according to what we were taught today in school, she possibly may not even have one!
