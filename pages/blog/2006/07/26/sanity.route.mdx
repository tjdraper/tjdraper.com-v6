It does appear that some measure of sanity has been brought into the Abraham Cherrix case which you can read about [HERE](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=51232). I still find it most disturbing (as does my friend Paul at [Josiah Project](http://www.josiahproject.com/)) that after he is done fighting all these legal issues he still has to fight cancer. What a stupid thing this is! What gives anyone the right to tell this young man how he shall treat his cancer?
