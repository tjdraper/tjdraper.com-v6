It’s so irritating to wreck a new car… well, new to us anyway! It was a three car accident, the area of Franklin I was in can be pretty congested, and so it was yesterday afternoon. I stopped behind a long line of cars… The guy behind me stopped… The guy behind him DID NOT!!!

I heard the screeching tires, by the time I heard him hit the car behind me I had sat back in my seat and squeezed the brakes as hard as I could. I figured it would be nice to keep from hitting the car in front of me, I didn’t want to involve more cars than I had to. I came pretty close to hitting him, but was shy by a couple of inches. I pulled over, and thankfully so did both of the others involved. The damage to my car wasn’t horrible, but enough to make me want to fix it. The bumper has a big nice dent in it, the reflective piece that runs along the back of the trunk is cracked and busted in a couple of places, something is wrong with the driver side rear light, and the trunk no longer seals properly as the trunk lid is bowed upward in the middle!

I can say however, that I’m thankful no one was hurt.
