Can someone please tell me what right the state has in telling someone what treatment for an illness they can or cannot accept? The state has no right here! This is not the states jurisdiction. The state’s job as defined biblically is to punish the evildoer. We are told in the bible the government bears a sword to punish the evildoer, yet this doesn’t look like a very good use of the sword to me! I’m talking of [Abraham Cherrix](http://www.abrahamsjourney.com/contact.html)!

For a great take on this issue please look at my friend Paul’s [POST](http://www.josiahproject.com/2006/07/24/right-to-privacy-abridged-state-owns-children/) on his blog [Josiah Project](http://www.josiahproject.com/) about it.
