It occurs to me that the grass grows the most at the hotest time of the year. Since I was so busy, and it was so hot, I got about 2 1/2 weeks behind on mowing the lawn. I might add that my lawn is a little over twice the size of the average lawn. I think I sweat out about two gallons of water this evening (I might be exagerating) and I only mowed half of it. Why can’t the grass grow more when it’s cooler out?
