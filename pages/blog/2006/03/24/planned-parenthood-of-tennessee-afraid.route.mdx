[Thanks to Vision Tennessee for bringing this to my attention.](http://visiontennessee.com/2006/03/22/planned-parenthood-on-tennessee-is-afraid-and-they-should-be/)

As Paul stated, he received an “urgent appeal” from Planned Parenthood today that said they needed him to contact the 2006 Public Health Family Assistance Sub-Comm concerning SJR-127 which [just passed](http://visiontennessee.com/2006/03/09/sjr-127-prolife-referendum-bill-passed-by-tn-state-senate-2/) the Senate.

Planned Parenthood is [providing the means](http://www.ppaction.org/campaign/House127Mar06/) to allow everyone to contact the committee members. When you click the link it has a default text in the message box, which can be edited along with the subject line. Paul sent his own personalized email which you can read at the first link in this post, and below is the letter I sent:

> Subject:
> Please vote YES on SJR-127
>
> As a Tennessean, I’m elated about SJR127, the proposed amendment to our Constitution that would remove the so called right to abortion for the women of Tennessee. Our state Constitution exists to help protect the people’s rights, including the rights of unborn children!!!
>
> SJR127 has passed in the Senate, and I understand it will be up before the Public Health and Family Assistance subcommittee in the next few weeks. Please vote for this life affirming, morally sound bill.
>
> While the Senators who voted for SJR127 are doing their duty to protect the lives of Tennessee’s unborn children, very little is being done to criminalize those who would seek to perpetrate this crime on those children.
>
> SJR127 is not the complete solution, but it is a step in the right direction,
>
> Please stand up for the rights of women AND UNBORN CHILDREN in this great state, and vote FOR SJR-127.
>
> Thank you for your courage and leadership.

Please send your personalized email [here](http://www.ppaction.org/campaign/House127Mar06/) and urge them to vote yes, and take a step in the right direction.

Thanks Paul for the heads up!
