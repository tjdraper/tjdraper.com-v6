Yesterday marked my parent’s 25th wedding anniversary. My wife and I, and the two oldest of my younger sisters planned a surprise celebration for after church. They were actually able to sneak old pictures and wedding pictures out of the house without mom or dad figuring it out. It was great.

We had a potluck meal after church, decorated the place with balloons and had nice red table cloth and nice stuff like that. We also made mom and dad cut the cake (I was disappointed that we didn’t make them stuff each others face though).

I have been privileged to be raised by some wonderful parents and they have set an excellent role model for myself and Rachel, as well as for the rest of the children when they get married.

During the course of events my dad was asked to share some words of wisdom about how to make it to 25 years of marriage in a culture with such a high divorce rate as ours. Indeed, my dad has said before that of all the friends he had from his younger years, of all his peers, he is the only one that has made it this far. His words of wisdom were that you love each other no matter what. When the Bible says, husbands love your wives, it was issuing a command. There is no choice in whether or not you love your wife. He also said that it is a decision you make, you decide that divorce is not an option.

I think that in our culture today, we go into marriage with the idea that divorce is always an option if we become dissatisfied. Actually that idea fails to recognize that our Lord Jesus Christ only gave only one reason for divorce, and that was adultery. In other words the only acceptable divorce is if your spouse has committed adultery. The Bible gives no other case for divorce.

So, my mom and dad made the decision that there would be no divorce because God said so. That’s how they made it to 25 years, and also of course by the grace of God who enables them to keep the covenant that they made, and who enabled them to realize that they were making a covenant of such a nature that could not be so easily broken as our culture likes to think.
