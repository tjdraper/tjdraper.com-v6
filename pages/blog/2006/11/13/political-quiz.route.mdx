I just took this very interesting political quiz, below is my score:

**ACCORDING       TO YOUR ANSWERS,**

          _You fall exactly on the border_

_of         two political philosophies__..._

.

**CONSERVATIVE**

**LIBERTARIAN**

**
CONSERVATIVES**        tend to favor economic freedom, but frequently

support         laws to restrict personal behavior that violates “traditional
values.” They oppose excessive government control of business,

while         endorsing government action to defend morality and the

traditional         family structure. Conservatives usually support a strong

military,        oppose bureaucracy and high taxes, favor a free-market

economy,        and endorse strong law enforcement.

**LIBERTARIANS**        support maximum liberty in both personal

and         economic matters. They advocate a _much_ smaller government;

one         that is limited to protecting individuals from coercion

and         violence. Libertarians tend to embrace individual

responsibility,        oppose government bureaucracy and taxes,

promote         private charity, tolerate diverse lifestyles, support the

free         market, and defend civil liberties.

If you feel like taking the test, and if you feel like commenting, feel free to leave your score in the comments.
