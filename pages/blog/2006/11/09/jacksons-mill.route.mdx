Here are some pictures from our recent trip to Jackson’s Mill. Much to my chagrin I noticed after I got home that I hadn’t actually gotten any pictures of the mill.

It was very cold there so I had to bundle Allen up.

This is a cabin that they moved to this site. It is similar to the type of cabin Jackson lived in.

This is another cabin on the site. Very, very tiny. It is hard to believe entire families with lots of children lived in these small dwellings.

Here is a cute picture of Allen.
