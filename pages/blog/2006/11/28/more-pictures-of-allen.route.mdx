Allen is not feeling well today. Yesterday he woke up from a nap very unhappy and has been fussy ever since. He is also very congested and gassy and this is just adding to his discomfort. I finally gave him some Infant Tylenol and he seems to be able to sleep longer. He has been asleep for over an hour now. Hopefully he will feel better soon.

Here are some pictures from Thanksgiving.
