My wife cooked up a surprise for me this past Wednesday. You see, I had to go to Indiana on Monday a week ago for a [Franklin Films](http://www.franklinfilms.com) production, then I had to drive from there to Weston, WV for a [Franklin Springs Family Media](http://www.franklinsprings.com) production. Originally, we had intended for Rachel to drive our other car over to meet us in Weston, WV, but ultimately decided it was too expensive and that we could not afford it. However, my friends, [Mark and Amy Stubblefield](http://www.mstub.com/blog) got wind of this and arranged with my wife for her and the baby to ride with them. I was kept unaware until I arrived at Jacksonâ€™s Lodge in Weston, where my wife greeted me when I walked into the room. I was quite pleasantly surprised.

We are home now however and are glad to be back!
