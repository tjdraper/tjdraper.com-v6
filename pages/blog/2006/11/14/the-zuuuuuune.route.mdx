Well it seems the “[iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html) killer” [Zune](http://www.zune.net/en-US/) has finally come out. I saw it today at Office Depot, and then again at Staples. Funny thing, there was NOBODY at the displays, NOBODY buying these things.

I fiddled with one (yes I touched something that came from Microsoft.. SHUDDER) and I think I will keep my iPod thank you very much.
