Saturday, January 21st, I attended the funeral of Connie Mack Waller. Connie was Tommy Waller’s father who appeared in the film _A Journey Home_. Connie left his temporary dwelling place on January 16, 2006 to be with his Lord and Savior. Connie was loved by all who knew him. I have never, ever heard anyone say a bad word about Connie. All of us left behind him will miss him. But we know that he desired to go, especially in the last days as the cancer continued to claim him.

I realize many of my readers have no idea who Connie is, or if you do, you only know the name. But Connie affected the lives of those around him in a profound way. It was amazing to see at his funeral, so many people that he had touched in some way. Connie was one of those people that taught with his life. I have never seen him get angry for any reason. He never blamed God for his cancer, or for the fact that he would die relatively young. He never complained, he always said his life was in the hands of a sovereign God. His testimony was very, very powerful in life, and as much so in his death as during the funeral many people gave testimony to his incredible faith.

I believe it would be very hard for me to be faced with the same circumstances and not be bitter about them. I pray that as I grow, the Holy Spirit will make me more like Connie in that Connie was like our Lord.

Do you all think I am exaggerating about Connie’s life and testimony? That’s because you didn’t know him. No he wasn’t perfect, but you could clearly see Christ in him. And that’s what I want when people look at me. I want them to see Christ.
