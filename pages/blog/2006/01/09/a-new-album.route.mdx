Get ready everyone, I’m getting ready to produce an album. As yet, I don’t have a sure way to market it and get it out, but I have several ideas. My friend (also guitar teacher), is collaborating with me on this album. The album will contain 6 of his songs and 6 of mine. We are only in the very early stages of pre-production, but I am aiming to have it ready by at least the end of the summer.

When the album becomes available, all the songs on the music section of my site will no longer be available for download. I expect they will be replaced with previews. Stay tuned for more details.
