Starting Friday, Charles and I had a weekend recording session (Charles is my co-producer/co-musician on my up and coming album). We did practically nothing but record, stopping only to go to church on Sunday morning and have lunch at my parents after church. We also did stop for sleep a little bit now and thenâ€¦

To summarize, I am exhausted!
