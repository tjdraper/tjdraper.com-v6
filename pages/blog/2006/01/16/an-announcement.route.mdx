Hello to all those who read my blog. I know I haven’t posted much lately, but there is a good reason for it. Yes I’m going to pull out the normal bag of excuses such as, not enough time, too much going on, no internet at the house etc. etc.

But as to there not being enough time, I have been kept too busy to type up posts when I am at home for two very good reasons. First of all I have been working feverishly on the new album I’m producing! Secondly, I have had a lot more housework than normal when I get home from work. You see, my wife hasn’t felt much like doing the dishes or cleaning or any of that stuff lately so it sort of falls to me. But there is also a very good reason as to why she hasn’t felt like doing these things very much. Unfortunately her condition of late has been causing something called morning sickness.

So the announcement is that Rachel and I are expecting! As I said however, Rachel has been having a lot of morning sickness though. We are really hoping this will go down during the second trimester (next month).

We hope that this will be the first of many covenant children that God will grant us to raise. The ultimate goal of my life right now is to raise children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord for the furtherance of His kingdom. As I’m sure that any reader of this blog that has been reading for any length of time must know by now, we believe that children are a blessing from the Lord. And God has given me a vision (passed on to me by my parents and to Rachel by her parents) of not limiting the amount of blessing the Lord will bestow upon us. May the Lord grant me the wisdom to raise up children that will serve and honor Him! And may the Lord bless us with children according to his will and purpose.
