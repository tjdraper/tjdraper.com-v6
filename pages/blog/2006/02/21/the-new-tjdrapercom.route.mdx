I have finally perfected the new look you see on my website to the point where I have gone public with it. There is of course still more to be done, but the main designing is out of the way.

This is one of the projects I have been working on in my hours after work, along with mixing music for the new album, shoeing horses for extra income (on Saturdays), and I am also taking on a new video project this weekend to add to the list.

This promises to be a busy, but great year!
