I have just returned from a long weekend of filming in Illinois. [David Price](http://dpricejr.blogspot.com/), my brother-in-law, and myself were filming a conference put on by [Providence Church](http://www.providencefamilyoffaith.com). The speakers were Dan Ford, and [Roger Schultz](http://www.liberty.edu/academics/arts-sciences/history/index.cfm?PID=4956). Unfortunately I wasn’t able to concentrate on what they had to say as I was busy trying to get good shots with the camera I was operating, and trying to get good audio as well. But am told that it was awesome… I will be getting plenty of it while I’m in the edit bay I’m sure ![wink](wink.gif).
