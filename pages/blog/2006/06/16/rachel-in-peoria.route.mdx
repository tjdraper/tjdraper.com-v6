It has really come to my attention this past week how much Rachel really does around here. She left for Peoria to visit her family and left me behind here in Tennessee. At this point, you should see the pile of mail and other stuff that has accumulated on her desk since she left. O, I keep up with where our money is going for the most part, and I know roughly how much money we have, but I hate dealing with bills and balancing and all that (I’m the creative type remember?). So she does all the bills, balancing, bookeeping etc. And then we sit down every so often and I look over things, and she tells me what’s going on in our world. Well, there’s so much paper work sitting on her desk right now it makes me sick to think about. All I can say is I’m glad I don’t have to do this by myself!

She’s driving back home as I write this. I’m expecting her around 10:30 tonight.

Anyway, for any married men who might need a reminder, cherish your wife… I know I will do so all the more with this reminder, and especially with our anniversary in two days!
