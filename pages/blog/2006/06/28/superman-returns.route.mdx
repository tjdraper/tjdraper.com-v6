Okay, call me a geek or a dork, but I went to see this movie at it’s first showing here where I live… at 10:00 pm at night! I was not disappointed. This is a great story, one that holds my attention. There is not one boring part of this movie, and it follows logically in the footsteps of Superman 1 and 2, which is where it’s supposed to pick up… after Superman 2. They made the decision to pretend like 3 and 4 had not been made, a wise choice I thought since those were both stupid!

As far as characters go, Brandon Routh does an excellent job at filling Christopher Reeves’ shoes. He did as believable a job at convincing us that Clark would be hard to recognize as Superman as Reeves did, and he portrayed the man of steel with many of the same traits that Reeves did. Since I thought that Reeves always did a good job as the man of steel, this was a plus in my opinion.

Kate Bosworth is so much better a choice to cast as Lois Lane it’s not even funny. I always found Margott Kidder the most annoying version of Lois Lane ever! She always left me thinking, “Now how on earth can Superman like this woman?” But Kate Bosworth’s Lois Lane is not annoying at all. She plays the role with just enough intelligence, and yet she can still get herself into trouble! Of course the man in the red cape can pull her out of anything she gets into anyway right?

And now we come to the villain, Lex Luthor! Lex is portrayed by Kevin Spacey who knocks it clear out of the park! Kevin manages to pull off a much more mature and evil Lex Luthor than Gene Hackman did, and still keep the character’s basic traits, and at times goofiness. I really enjoyed Spacey’s performance as Superman’s arch-vilain.

The special effects in this movie felt well integrated, and really enhanced the film. Again, this is a huge plus. With some films it almost seems as if the special effects we are able to accomplish these days gets in the way. But not in this film. It’s just the right mix in this film to make us believe what is going on, and to enhance what is going on without us really focusing in on it, or inhibiting the story. In fact, the only reason I noticed the special effects was because as a filmmaker I was looking at them. They really feel transparent in a way that makes you concentrate on the movie as a whole.

As I said, this was a very enjoyable movie and I think we are all set to make another one! I’m looking forward to it!
