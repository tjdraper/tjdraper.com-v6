The Waller Family (featured in the film _A Journey Home_ from [Franklin Springs Family Media](http://www.franklinspringsfamilymedia.com)) returned from Israel this past week and shared with us this past Sunday during our Church Service at [Covenant Family Fellowship](http://www.covenantfamily.us) about their trip and work in the “Holy Land” as it is called.

The problem in Israel is that they won’t even look at a New Testament. They don’t know what it says. They are told that it is wrong to read a New Testament and so they don’t. These people don’t even know what a Christian is, and are under the delusion that they are God’s chosen people so all will be alright. What they have failed to realize is that under the New Covenant (which they don’t even know exists), there is neither Jew nor Greek! God only has one people, one called out and chosen Holy people, not two. He doesn’t have a chosen physical people who don’t accept Jesus as the Messiah, and a chosen spiritual people who do.

Under God’s New Covenant that he has made with his people, we no longer have animal sacrifices because God’s sinless Son has paid for the covenant with his blood. Christ died to save His people. We as Gentiles have been grafted in because God did not spare the natural branches.

There is only one way by which we can come into this New Covenant, and it is through the blood which Jesus Christ shed on the cross.

Tommy and Sherri Waller are there to live among these people, and to show them what Christians are. They are ministering in Israel as God’s instruments to reach those whom God would have them reach, that some may be brought into the New Covenant. To bring them out of the delusion that because they have some Old Covenant connection that they will somehow be alright.

This is what the Wallers are called to do, and let me tell you that they certainly have a zeal for doing it. Though I do not agree with all of Tommy’s doctrine or beliefs, particularly in regards to how God’s covenant works, and who God’s people are, I can support them in the effort to reach the Jews with the gospel of Christ. For this is one of the things we are called to do as believers.

> **Matthew 28:19-20**  
> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

May the the Lord continue to strengthen and bless the Wallers, as they minister to these people!
