We got a little wet on this ride…

We went on a ride called the Powder Keg. The interesting thing about this ride is that it went from about zero to 60 in about 2 seconds. It was some kind of take off. They also had a little bit of humor when building this ride:

We also went on a tour of Marvel Cave:

It is hard to get good pictures in the dark with an automatic camera and for other reasons… if you know what you are looking at, you can see the entrance to the cave and the stairs down into it.
