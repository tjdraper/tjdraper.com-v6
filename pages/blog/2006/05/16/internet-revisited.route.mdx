Okay, so the Verizon wireless, PC Slot card didnâ€™t work out so well. It was slow and unreliable. So I cashed in on my 15 day trial and ordered DSL from our local phone service provider, which is Bellsouth. Though I only got the 1.5 Mbps/256 Kbps, it seems awfully fast, at least at the moment. Granted I just set it up but it seems faster than the T1 connection I have at Franklin Films in Franklin. But that could also be because there are several business suites in our office building and we all share the same T1 connection. I imagine that slows things down a bit.

Anyway, so now I think I am connected for real!
