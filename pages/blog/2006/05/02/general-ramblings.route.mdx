I am excited to finally have the [City On a Hill](http://www.tjdraper.com/film/providencelectureseries.html) project in the preview stage finally, but that sure doesn’t mean I can rest now…

I have so much going on it’s not even funny, but I am very excited about everything in my life right now. It looks like I will be filming another lecture in Peoria at [Providence Church](http://www.providencefamilyoffaith.org) if all goes according to plan. This will just be one lecture though instead of five. It will be on the 4th of July weekend and Dr. Schultz will be the speaker. With his knowledge of history and his wonderful speaking style it should be a great 4th of July weekend.

I also need to turn my attention back to my album and try to get some work done on that.

During my regular work day at Franklin Films /  Franklin Springs Family Media, we are going like crazy on several projects, not the least of which is the Amy Grant Live DVD.

I have also been adding to this site one page at a time. I just finished a little bit of work on the film section. It seems to be going so agonizingly slow…

Rachel purchased _The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe_ for me last weekend. It is just as good as I remember it from the theater, though the surround sound and experience of the theater was much better of course. It still strikes me how a good and Godly movie can still be made today and do really well.

We also rented _The Fugitive_ this past weekend and that was such a great movie. As far as secular actors go, Harrison Ford has to be one of the best.

Okay, I think that’s it for my general ramblings for now. It’s interesting how I have just had nothing to post about lately, so that’s exactly what I’m posting about ![wink](wink.gif).
