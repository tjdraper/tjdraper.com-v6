WARNING, there will be a few plot spoilers ahead. I’ll try to keep them few…

This movie was almost not worth seeing. It felt very contrived and Hokey!!! They felt a need to kill off key characters early in the story for NO APPARENT REASON. I don’t mind the death of a character if it serves a purpose, but I didn’t see a purpose in the death of… argh, that would be too much of a plot spoiler.

Well anyway, I also felt like all the characters except Logan were out of character. And while Storm is decent in this movie there were times when she felt out of character as well.

The new things introduced into this movie felt contrived since they were never mentioned before, like Jean’s split personality, and the levels of Mutants.

Some of the dialog is horribly cheesy!!! This movie could have used a real script and a better director, like maybe the director that directed X-1 and X-2.

All in all, it was not worth the money I spent to see it nor the time. If you want to see X-men worth watching, go rent the first or second one!!! I was very VERY disappointed with this movie!
