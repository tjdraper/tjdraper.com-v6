<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I do think this film suffers from that one thing I mentioned early in my review when speaking of Nolan’s previous films, and that is a trumped up sense of self importance. Many times throughout this film, Hans Zimmer’s score swells to unbelievable heights meant to communicate to us the importance of this entire trek and film for mankind. There were at least four recitations of Dylan Thomas’ poem, “Do not go gentle into that good night,” which borders on the point of tedium. The tone is somber and solemn indeed. In fact I would say this film suffers from it. I cannot remember a single joke that worked or was put forth in a way to lighten the mood or the tension. Not a single line of this film was uttered in triviality. But that doesn’t work very well because that’s not the way humans operate. In life we need something to break up the tension once in a while, and in films we do too. What makes a film tedious is often not so much its length (although that can obviously have a major impact), but its unrelenting solemnity. Throughout its 2hr 49m runtime, the film never gives us a break, and the result is tedium.</p>

<p>From my review of&nbsp;<em>Interstellar</em>, the latest offering from director Christopher Nolan which is now in theaters. I saw it last night in theaters with a good friend of mine in preparation for&nbsp;<em>The MovieByte Podcast</em>, and to write the review about it I’ve linked to here.</p>

<p>This marks me starting to try to use my personal blog to promote my other work. It may not work, it may fail utterly. And it may be weird to link to myself, but I'm trying something here.</p>
