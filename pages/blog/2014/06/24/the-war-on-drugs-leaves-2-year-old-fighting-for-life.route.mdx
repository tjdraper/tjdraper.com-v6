> After the SWAT team broke down the door, they threw a flashbang grenade inside. It landed in my son’s crib.
>
> Flashbang grenades were created for soldiers to use during battle. When they explode, the noise is so loud and the flash is so bright that anyone close by is temporarily blinded and deafened. It’s been three weeks since the flashbang exploded next to my sleeping baby, and he’s still covered in burns.

> There’s still a hole in his chest that exposes his ribs. At least that’s what I’ve been told; I’m afraid to look.

Why was this disgusting atrocity committed?

> My husband’s nephew, the one they were looking for, wasn’t there. He doesn’t even live in that house. After breaking down the door, throwing my husband to the ground, and screaming at my children, the officers – armed with M16s – filed through the house like they were playing war. They searched for drugs and never found any.

Drugs. This is because of drugs.

> I heard my baby wailing and asked one of the officers to let me hold him. He screamed at me to sit down and shut up and blocked my view, so I couldn’t see my son. I could see a singed crib. And I could see a pool of blood. The officers yelled at me to calm down and told me my son was fine, that he’d just lost a tooth. It was only hours later when they finally let us drive to the hospital that we found out Bou Bou was in the intensive burn unit and that he’d been placed into a medically induced coma.

This is outrageous — OUTRAGEOUS!

> Every morning, I have to face the reality that my son is fighting for his life. It’s not clear whether he’ll live or die. All of this to find a small amount of drugs?

The "war" on drugs has never, ever been right, but this sort of thing shows just how crazy it actually is. This is tyranny, not freedom and it's disgusting, immoral, and wholly reprehensible.

I really liked this sarcastic comment made down in the comments section on the linked article. I don't often read the comments, but I happened to see this one and it was good:

> Look people, we can't have people putting plants into their bodies, your body is state property.  You don't own yourself.  If a few babies have to be blown up to keep that evil plant out of people's bodies than so be it.

This is what we've come to as a nation. May God help us.
