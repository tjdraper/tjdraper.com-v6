Here are the things I’ve been talking and writing about over at [MovieByte](http://moviebyte.com/).

_The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1_
--------------------------------------

Last week, the focus was _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1_. I quite liked the film. Fizz joined me on the podcast since Joe needed to take a week off, and he didn't like it as much as I did.

I wrote a review as well:

> TJ and Fizz discuss what’s good and bad about ‘The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1’. As ever, they don’t always see eye to eye, but that will give you, dear listeners, some fun things to chew on. They also discuss the redesign of the MovieByte website, Disney’s live action ‘Cinderella’ trailer (no, really, it’s a thing), the Russos possibly directing ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ parts one and two as opposed to Joss Whedon — which leads to a lot of discussion — and of course what theaters will have the ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ trailer.

> Don’t let the critics fool you. They are such a fickle lot. The [Rotten Tomatoes Critic Consensus](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hunger_games_mockingjay_part_1) says that the film comes up short on the action. As if the critics think action is the end all and be all — what a joke. I found the film to be compelling, it did in fact have some action which I deemed to be enough for me, I liked the pacing and much of the acting, the story is improved upon from the book, and I quite enjoyed watching the film in the theater.

_Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ Teaser Trailer
---------------------------------------------

Last week, Disney and Lucas Film released the first teaser trailer for _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_. Despite some misgivings, I'm super excited!

> Overall, I’d say this teaser is trying to strike a balance between making us feel nostalgia for the old _Star Wars_ (and I certainly don’t mean any of the prequels), and making us feel like this is something altogether new and interesting and different.

> It’s a special bonus episode of The MovieByte Podcast where TJ, Joe, and Clark talk about — actually dissect might be a better word — the first new teaser trailer for ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’. There’s no shortage of opinions, fun, and just generally geeking out. You won’t want to miss this!

_Birdman_
---------

Joe and I had intended to review _The Immitation Game_ on The MovieByte Podcast this week, but it turns out that film is in an extremely limited release at the moment. We didn't feel like driving a few thousand miles to see it. So we decided to see _Birdman_ and talk about it instead.

[**The MovieByte Podcast #116: It Felt Purposeless »**](http://moviebyte.com/mbpodcast/116)

> TJ and Joe didn’t get to watch the movie they wanted to watch because it was in limited release, so they watched ‘Birdman’ instead. And they are glad they did. There’s a lot to chew on with Birdman and TJ and Joe relish in the analysis. Also don’t miss some follow up on ‘The Force Awakens’ trailer, news of the ‘House of Cards’ season 3 premiere date, and Batman vs. Darth Vader. It’s most impressive!

[**Birdman — Review »**](http://moviebyte.com/entry/2014/12/birdman)

> This film is filled with fantastic performances, not the least of which is, of course, Michael Keaton. There is hardly a moment when the film leaves his headspace. He plays someone who has become quite the odd-ball.
