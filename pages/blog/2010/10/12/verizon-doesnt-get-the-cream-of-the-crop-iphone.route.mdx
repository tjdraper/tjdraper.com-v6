Boy the iPhone on Verizon rumors are just toppling all over each other now! It’s an interesting idea, and one that would give credence to a January launch of iPhone 4 on Verizon. It could then be possible that iPhone 5 would launch only on AT&T, and follow on Verizon the following January.

As I say, it’s an interesting idea, but I don’t think I put any stock in it.
