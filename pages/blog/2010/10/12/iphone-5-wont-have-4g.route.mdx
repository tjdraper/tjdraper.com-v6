I would be shocked if iPhone 5 had 4G/LTE. 4G is just getting rolling, the chipsets have not been made power efficient yet (and woe betide iPhone users should Apple use an even more power hungry chipset!), and it’s yet another chipset that the phone would have to add to existing chipsets because of the need to fall back on older technologies in outlying regions.

Now, the whole idea of iPhone 5 being dual mode (actually, it would be tri-mode, GSM/UMTS/CDMA) is interesting. I’m not sure I consider it likely though because it seems like the chipset would have to take up more room and energy and I doubt Apple would be keen on that. I think if Apple wants CDMA to be part of the iPhone, it makes sense to make a soley CDMA version of iPhone. Seems the phone can be more efficient that way to me. But what do I know.

It’s all still rumor anyway.
