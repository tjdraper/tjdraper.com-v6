Yeah, so that explains something. Pretty unbelievable, even for Windows. Creating an ad hoc network without my permission? I’d throw my mac in the river if it did something like that! But it certainly explains why sometimes I see those ad hoc networks hanging around sometimes when I’m out somewhere with my laptop.

Brilliant Microsoft!
