So the Wall Street Journal speaks very authoritatively in saying,

> Apple Inc. is making a version of its iPhone that Verizon Wireless will sell early next year, according to people familiar with the matter, ending an exclusive deal with AT&T and sharpening the competition with Google Inc.-based phones.

This still amounts to nothing more than a rumor. However, the Wall Street journal has a history of being pretty close to the mark on these things when it comes to Apple. And yet I still don’t buy it. I’ll be happy to be proven wrong, and will almost certainly switch the instant my contract is up with AT&T.

Here’s John Gruber (Daring Fireball) on the issue,

> Note that there’s a difference between Apple making a CDMA iPhone and Verizon carrying it. The WSJ is only reporting what I did [two months ago](http://daringfireball.net/2010/08/n92): that a CDMA iPhone 4 is heading toward production. They’re not saying Verizon has agreed to carry it.

In the mean time, Verizon has announced their 4G plans, they are launching in even more cities than originally announced this year. And they have their 4G coverage locator on line already. I found it interesting that my little town already has Verizon 4G running here. I checked some other locations further away from Nashville and did get a “no 4G here yet” message so I guess it’s true. Meanwhile AT&T only has 2G here at my house!
