If you can’t put another carrier’s SIM card in, then unlocking is a moot point. And since in this rumor, Apple would be providing the app and/or service that lets you choose your carrier, then Apple can determine which carriers are available to you depending on the deals they have with carriers in your area. It really defeats the purpose of the SIM card, but then, so does carrier locking.
