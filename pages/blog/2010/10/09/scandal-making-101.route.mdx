In this article, The Macalope gives an excelent response to [Ryan Block’s “Glassgate”](http://gdgt.com/discuss/with-antennagate-over-is-glassgate-next-iphone-ani/) (please, PLEASE STOP with the “gate” thing!). Here’s a juicy excerpt:

> > Apple has apparently found that non-bumper style cases — specifically those that slide onto the iPhone 4, which are occasionally prone to particulate matter getting caught between the rear of the phone and the case — can cause unexpected scratching that could quickly develop into full-on cracking or even much larger fracturing of the entire rear pane of glass.
> 
> What kind of particles and cases are we talking about, here? Ones made of kryptonite or adamantium?
