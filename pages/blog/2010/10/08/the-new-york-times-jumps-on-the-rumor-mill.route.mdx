(Yes, The New York Times capitalized the “i” in iPhone!)

So let’s think about this for a minute. Apple releases new iPhones around June or July every year, these rumors just don’t add up to me. Why would you release a CDMA iPhone 4 six months before iPhone 5?

I will say this though, Android is a major player now, and Android phones have gained dominance because Apple refuses (refused?) to make a CDMA iPhone. If Apple releases a CDMA iPhone for Verizon before they release the iPhone 5 it will be for one reason - to crush Android.
