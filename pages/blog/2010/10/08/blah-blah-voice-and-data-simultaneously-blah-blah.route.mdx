  The Wall Street Journal: With Verizon on the Horizon, iPhone Users Weigh Leaving AT&T—but There's a Catch

> The cellular network of AT&T, the current iPhone provider, runs on a standard called UMTS. Verizon’s uses something called CDMA, and that will make a difference in how the phones work.

Okay first of all, Roger Cheng makes this blanket statement that AT&T runs on a standard called UMTS. Oh really? Then how come my iPhone says “E” on it instead of 3G right now? It would be more accurate to say that AT&T’s network runs on a standard called GSM, with UMTS tacked on in locations AT&T feels warrant such extravagance. But I get what he’s saying. Let’s move on.

> Most notably, Verizon customers aren’t able to surf the Web or exchange email while they’re talking on their phone. That sort of on-the-go multitasking—which AT&T and iPhone maker Apple Inc. have touted in advertising—might seem a little much to many people, but it’s often what iPhone users are signing up for.

He’s right that Apple and AT&T tout this feature, especially AT&T. In fact AT&T seems to think it’s a killer feature to hear them talk about it (never mind that it does me no good since I’m in an EDGE area). Thing is, I find it very hard to surf the web **when my phone is up to my ear!** To be fair, I have accessed data before while on a 3G call, but not very often. out of the roughly five times I have done so, twice the call dropped while trying to access that data. Lame!

The other thing of course about this killer feature is that, even in 3G areas, I often drop back to GSM (2G) while on a call. Quite often. So much for that feature.

And I have never _needed_ this feature. In fact I really could not care less about voice and data simultaneously and I wish Apple and AT&T would pull their heads out of the sand and realize that most people (anyone I’ve talked to, real scientific you know!) don’t care about getting data while talking on the phone.

And the other thing people need to realize is that a large portion of AT&T users still can’t access data while on a call because they are on AT&T’s GSM network not UMTS!
