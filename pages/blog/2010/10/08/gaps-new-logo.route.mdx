Okay I know, not strictly Apple related. But it’s buzzing around the interwebz, and I browse the internet from my Apple laptop so it’s relevant.

Look just trust me!

So Gap introduced a new logo and the online “community” is in an uproar. Believe it or not I didn’t actually have a problem with their new logo but whatever. So everyone has their pants in a bunch over this deal and so Gap’s president responded:

[The Gap’s New Logo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marka-hansen/the-gaps-new-logo_b_754981.html)

And then I saw this wonderful response (hat tip to [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/08/mike-gap)):

[Dear Gap, I have your new logo.](http://weblog.muledesign.com/2010/10/dear_gap_i_have_your_new_logo.php)

I mean… well played! I love it.
