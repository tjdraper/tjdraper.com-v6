You really must take 90 seconds to read the linked article. It’s a point well made as far as I’m concerned. None of these other weasel-ey, copycat companies can hope to even come close to what Apple is doing with it’s truly integrated approach.

Both Android and Windows being “open”, if I squint hard enough I can just visualize the tweet from Andy Rubin of the command line to build a new Windows 8 with Android mojo. The Android Market selling Windows Apps. It will be beautiful.
