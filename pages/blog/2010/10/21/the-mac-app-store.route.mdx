So Apple announced the Mac App Store and I think it’s absolutely brilliant. Of course, Steve was careful to mention that this is _another_ way to discover and download apps on the Mac. But while this is in addition to everything we already have and know, I tend to think this is going to be wildly popular. Why wouldn’t it be? You load up the app store, find an app you want, and download it. No chasing it down all over the web.
