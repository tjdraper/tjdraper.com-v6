[Tread Lightly When Embracing The Mac App Store](http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/10/21/tread-lightly-when-embracing-the-mac-app-store/)

> When Apple rolls out the Mac App Store in three months’ time, it will have created a new “class” of Mac software: Apple-approved and App Store-certified. All of a sudden software that isn’t from the Mac App Store looks a little less… official.

Yeah okay, maybe. But I’m totally fine with a Mac App Store as long as it is not the only official way to install apps. However, while I would be greatly disappointed if Apple eventually closed down the Mac platform, there would always be a jailbreak. Look at iOS. Every iOS device to date has been jailbroken. And the Macintosh platform is big, and a lot of the apps it runs are big. And I also mean big as in no way you would even consider downloading it over the App Store. Take a look at Adobe Creative Suite or Final Cut Studio. They are both just way too massive to be downloaded over most internet connections. I wouldn’t even want to do it over my 20Mbps connection at work. I don’t think Apple will ever lock the Mac down to just their App store.

> New Mac users—and there’s sure to be plenty given Apple’s year-on-year growth—will be trained from Day One to look to the Mac App Store for software. What happens to software developers who, for whatever reason, don’t want to be a part of the Mac App Store? Why would a new Mac user visit third-party sites like MacUpdate or VersionTracker to find software when they know they can always pull up the Mac App Store to find Apple-approved, App Store-certified software?

So what? Apple can’t put their stamp of approval on specific software for their operating system? I don’t get it. I’ll say it again. So what?

> You can also be sure that Apple will leverage the Mac App Store to sell its own software, further boosting the status of all software found on the Mac App Store.

No… ya think?

Man I’m trying not to pick this thing apart sentence by sentence, but it’s hard!

> During yesterday’s demonstration, Apple showed how easy it is to buy, download, and install Pages, the word processor component of its iWork suite, using the Mac App Store. (Not showed, of course, is just how easy it is to download and install software using the decade old apt-get system…

Puleeze! I’ve messed around with Linux enough to know what he’s talking about, but I never found it easy. Apple is doing this for the average person. apt-get is not for the average person!

> ...but let’s leave that alone for the moment. Steam also says hi, perhaps gritting its teeth a little bit.) What Mac user is going to go out of his or her way to find and download software when they can just as easily pop up the Mac App Store—safe, tested, secure—and browse away from there?

So wait, are we actually trying to say here that it’s bad that Apple is hosting a store where the software is safe, tested and secure?

> And perhaps bordering on the conspiratorial, why would you want Apple granting or denying its seal of approval on the software you run on your computer? I thought these were called personal computers? Who’s to say, somewhere down the line, that Apple doesn’t decide that the Mac App Store is the only place where new software can be acquired? For your safety, dear Mac user, we’ve eliminated the ability to launch .app bundles not delivered by the Mac App Store. We hope you understand that this is being done with your best interests in mind. Thank you for choosing Apple.

Okay, this is just crazy talk, enough said.

> Do I expect that to ever happen? Obviously not—that’s ridiculous, even for Apple…

So why did you go there? I don’t get it.

There are some people, who just aren’t going to “get” Apple no matter how good Apple does.
