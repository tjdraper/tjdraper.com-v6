All I can say is, YES! The Mac is my first (Apple) love! It’s good that Apple is reafirming they have not abandoned the platform.

If the image Apple included with the invite is any indication, we will get a preview look at a new big cat, possibly named Lion based on the image. Also the 3D Apple logo makes me wonder if “Lion” will have some earth shattering 3D eye candy.

Also, I’ll expect this new version of OS X to make my existing hardware even faster, as every version of OS X ever released has been faster (if only somewhat, at times) than the previous version.
