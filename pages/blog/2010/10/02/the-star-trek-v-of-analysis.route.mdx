> Ever see “Star Trek V”? It’s a horrible, horrible movie, but the Macalope’s always found the scene where Captain Kirk asks “Why does God need a starship?” to be a guilty pleasure. Probably because he feels like he’s also often the only one who asks the obvious questions to talking heads. Like “Who were the ‘developers surveyed’?”

Love it! So geeky! You’ve gotta love to hate “Star Trek V”, I mean as a geek! It was almost as bad as “The Motion Picture.”

There’s also some “Phantom Menace” analogies in the article. Good stuff!
