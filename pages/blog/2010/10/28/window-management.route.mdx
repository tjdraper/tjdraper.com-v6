[Mac 101: Window Management in OS X](http://gigaom.com/apple/mac-101-window-management-in-os-x/)

The linked article is fine I suppose, but I’m really posting it because it reminded me of how bad window management is in Windows, and how good it is in OS X. And it’s an excuse for me to talk about it.

When I first switched from Windows to Mac, it did indeed feel a bit like being underwater. But it didn’t take me long to get past that because Mac window management does in fact work better and make more sense. I quickly learned to love Exposé! Microsoft still doesn’t have a good alternative to Exposé.

The biggest fundamental difference that you must acclimate to when switching to the Mac, is that Applications and windows are handled separately. This is actually a good thing. Let me use Photoshop to illustrate the paradigm. In OS X, an application like Photoshop opens a document in a window. If no documents (windows) are open, and you switch to Photoshop, you will see Photoshop’s toolbars, and the menubar will reflect that Photoshop is the active application with the appropriate menus. So Photoshop can and will remain open even though it doesn’t have any documents open. This is great because Photoshop is open and running and it doesn’t have to go through a startup routine when you are ready to open a Photoshop document.

Now of course, there are a few applications that are primarily single window focused, but even those, like a tabbed web browser for instance, will remain open even if all tabs are closed. So “closing” and “quitting” are two different paradigms in OS X (in Windows, closing may, or may not be quitting an Application). Closing all an app’s windows does not “quit” the app. To quit an app, you choose quit from the menu bar, or press “Apple + Q” keyboard shortcut.

Additionally, Apple’s placement of a single, system wide menu bar at the top of the screen maximizes muscle memory and ensures consistency. OS X applications must use the menu bar for drop down menus.
