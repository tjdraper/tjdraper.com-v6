I have [talked before](/article/2010/09/itunes-10-for-os-x) about my feelings on the OS X interface. Specifically I have mentioned my preference that the interface get out of the way. One of my big gripes with the remaining Auqua Candy elements of OS X is that they are kind of attention attracting. A good OS interface is about getting out of the way.

So that being the case, I have concluded that I actually like this new trend that started in iTunes 10.
