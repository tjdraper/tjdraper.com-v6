It’s a good article, and you should read the whole thing, but here’s my favorite part.

> What about today’s Mac developers?
> 
> They’ll be fine.

> Today’s market for Mac software isn’t going anywhere. People will continue to find (or not find) traditional apps in the traditional ways, and will continue to buy (or not buy) them in retail stores and from the vendors’ websites at about the same rates. In fact, as the Mac’s marketshare grows, this market will continue to grow with it.
> 
> But a huge new market is about to open next door. And yes, it’ll probably be dominated by Angry Birds and other inexpensive, often trivial apps. When this happens, a lot of traditional Mac developers are going to look down on it. But those with a bit of free time to develop their own inexpensive, often trivial apps might have a different viewpoint entirely when they see their sales numbers.
> 
> As both a Mac user and an iOS developer, I’m incredibly excited for the potential of this market.
