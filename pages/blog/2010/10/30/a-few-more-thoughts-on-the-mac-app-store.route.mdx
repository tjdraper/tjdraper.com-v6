The reactions of the various members of the Macintosh community, both developer and user, have varied greatly. Suffice it to say there is a great deal of trepidation. But let’s take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

**First Thought**

I don’t for a second believe that Apple will lock down the Mac so that you can only install from the App store. Certainly not anytime soon, but I don’t think it will every happen. Think about it for a minute. What are Macs good at? They are of course good at any number of things but the most well known is graphic design and professional film and video. What applications do graphic designers use? Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign… in short, the Adobe Creative Suite. I’m still on CS3 so I don’t know how big CS5 is, but CS3 came on a 4 gigabyte DVD. CS3 also has to install a lot of extra content in various different places on the hard drive in order to function properly. Libraries, databases, plugins. I’m guessing that much like iOS apps, and your current basic Mac apps, Mac App Store Apps are going to be single package applications. I don’t expect we will see Adobe’s Creative Suite in the App Store.

Then there’s Final Cut Studio. To install the full studio is some 40 gigabytes of content. Not going to be distributed over the Mac App Store. I guarantee it.

What about printer drivers? Sure OS X has a lot of printer drivers built in, but a new operating system only comes out every couple years, and printers are released in the mean time that need drivers. These will not be distributed via the App Store but will still need to be installed in the traditional way.

And do you really think Apple could get away with locking down the Mac from installing any App the user wants? Of course they can’t.

**Second Thought**

The user will drive the market. I expect the Mac App store will be a huge success and I expect that it will appeal most to a class of users who are probably not inclined to go hunting around on the Internet, or Best Buy for that matter, looking for software to install. This new channel will be safe, easy, and enticing. It’s a new channel to reach new customers. Why is this a bad thing? There may certainly be some crossover from the existing userbase, but there will almost certainly be new customers too. And those of us who already know how and where to look for software will not stop doing so. It’s a win/win situation.
