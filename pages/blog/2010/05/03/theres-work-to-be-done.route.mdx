We are very grateful to the Lord that we have not suffered near the damage or loss that so many around us have with all the flooding.

With that said, there is work to be done. Our driveway is currently unusable. Most of the top layer has washed into our front yard and there are big gullies washed in it of axel breaking proportions!

So lacking the necessary tools to effect the move of the gravel back into the driveway, I went to the store and got this to move the gravel back where it belongs:

My primary area of concern is right here:

It might be hard to get the scope of that from the pictures but believe me, If I were to try to drive over that, I believe serious damage to my car would ensue!

And one final picture for good measure.
