I’m telling you, that water that’s been coming out the sky… It’s wet! We haven’t washed away though…

yet…

Oh, and about that wet water, well there’s LOT’S of it! In fact, the road to where Heritage Church is currently meeting has been washed out, and there no power so Church has been canceled! I can’t remember if we’ve ever had to cancel services before.

Here’s what’s going on in my yard and driveway:

If you can’t see the video, I strongly recommend that you upgrade your browser to an HTML5 compliant browser. But in the event you don’t want to do that, try downloading the Quicktime file [here](/images/uploads/2010-05-01-flashflooding-drivewayissues/2010-05-01-flashflooding-drivewayissues.mp4).

And here’s a few pics:
