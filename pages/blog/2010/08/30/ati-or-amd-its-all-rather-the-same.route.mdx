I think ATI cards are (were?) consistently superior to Nvidia, and I’m sure the cards will continue to be stellar. However, I’m not sure the rebranding to AMD is such a good idea given that AMD is at least considered inferior (nowadays anyway) in the processor market. We shall see how it works for them. I don’t think it will stop me from getting ~ATI~ AMD cards.
