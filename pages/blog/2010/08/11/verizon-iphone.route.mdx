[John Gruber on N92 →](http://daringfireball.net/2010/08/n92)

I have a lot of respect for Gruber when it comes to Tech, and his opinions on Apple. He has a history of being right and of knowing whereof he speaks. And when it comes down to it, I almost always agree with him. So this is the most convinced I’ve been that there is a CDMA iPhone on it’s way to production. But even he is not sure it would come to Verizon. I am less sure. Let’s just say I’m still unconvinced that Apple would even make a CDMA variant of the iPhone. It would certainly represent a turn around from Apple’s previously stated position of making one iPhone at a time.

Despite my pessimistic attitude on a CDMA iPhone, I will speculate.

Earlier today I read someone worrying about platform and software fragmentation should Apple make two different hardware models of the iPhone at once. If they did go down that road, I personally believe we would not see any software differentiation, and probably not even any exterior differentiation between the two models. The only difference would be the cellular radios inside the phones, and the software would be modified under the hood accordingly. I mean really, look at OS X, and specifically look at the way it ran on both PowerPC and Intel processors for years with no differentiation to the user at all. I’m sure a lot of folks never realized or cared what all the fuss was about over this whole Power something, or Intel something or other. When they bought a new Mac, the software looked and behaved like their old (PowerPC) Mac. And OS X certainly knows how to communicate with all manner of different devices inside the different Macs over the years. Graphics cards, Processors, Logic Boards, you name it. Now remember that iOS is a variant of OS X. So I’m not particularly troubled about any fragmentation.

Also, another thought. Here’s where I think it would make sense for Apple to build a CDMA iPhone and make it available to Verizon (and Sprint even). The game has changed since Apple first stated it’s position that it intended only to make one iPhone at a time. And that game has been changed by Android. Specifically, the Motorola Droid, running Android (yes I know, it’s a little confusing), on Verizon. And to be frank, Droid is a good phone, and Android is a viable platform. Even I considered switching at one point (I know, I know, you need to sit down). But the point is, Verizon is frankly the best network in the U.S. and Android is really catching on. I am constantly berated by my Droid toting friends about my “choice” of network. So Android is serious competition to iPhone, and they have a significant advantage in the network department. It’s a funny thing, I don’t know anyone who “loves” AT&T, I certainly don’t. But I do know folks who “love” Verizon. And I certainly never had as many coverage issues with Verizon as I do with AT&T. But let’s say iPhone were to suddenly be available on the nation’s best network. I believe you would see iPhone trounce Android.

It will be interesting to see what happens.
