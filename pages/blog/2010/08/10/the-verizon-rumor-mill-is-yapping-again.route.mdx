But I still maintain that we will not see iPhone on Verizon until Big Red’s entire footprint has been overlaid with LTE _with_ voice support (no voice over 1x CDMA). The only other network in the U.S. that makes sense for the iPhone right now is T-Mobile. I’m willing to be wrong, but I don’t see Verizon happening till 2014 (their projected LTE completion date for overlaying their entire footprint).

I don’t blame Apple, and may even make the same decision were I in their shoes. From a worldwide technology standpoint it makes sense if you only want to make one phone at a time. But from my perspective, I hate choosing between great device w/mediocre network, or great network w/mediocre device. It’s quite frustrating! But apparently I’m willing to tough out the mediocre network for now.
