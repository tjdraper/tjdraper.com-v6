Well now, it seems like I’ve heard of Apple having tried this in the past, but not since I’ve been paying attention to Apple events. Guess who’s going to try to watch?!?

EDIT: As I saw pointed out in the comments section of [this 9to5mac entry](http://www.9to5mac.com/23443/apple-live-streaming-tomorrows-event), this could well be a direct result of the debacle at Apple’s last event where there were so many wi-fi devices in the room that it choked Jobs’ official wi-fi connection to his iPhone 4. It remains to be seen how restricted wi-fi generating devices will be at Apple’s event tomorrow.
