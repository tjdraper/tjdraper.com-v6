This is supposed to be a feature? Please! For anyone who thinks Apple has made a mistake concerning Flash, you _need_ to watch this video all the way through! This shows just how right Apple is. And I continue to maintain that if my phone was flash “capable” I would be looking for ways to block it as I do on my laptop browser.

(Also ironically, I was forced to watch the video in flash on my laptop, but it looks like it loads an iPhone friendly version if you watch from your phone.)
