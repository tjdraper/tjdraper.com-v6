[Why AT&T Just Isn’t Getting the Message](http://www.maclife.com/article/news/why_att_just_isnt_getting_message)

This would explain a lot in my book. Sadly, I think the problem is much deeper than this. AT&T is simply inept at all things related to their wireless network. I think they actually know they have a problem and just can’t get the ship turned around. It’s a vicious cycle for them really. They were mostly able to ignore the problem before the smartphone explosion known as iPhone. The iPhone made them and their users much more keenly aware of just how bad their network is, and now they are trying to fix it under the strain and demand of said smart phones. So if iPhone hadn’t come along they wouldn’t have fixed it. Now that iPhone has come along they can’t fix it. It’s a loose, loose situation for AT&T.

Now, this is purely speculation on my part, but I think one thing they could do that would actually really help a lot is roll out 3G to the rest of their network PRONTO! No, it wouldn’t cure all the problems but think about this for a moment.

1.  EDGE just sinks! Users on the 2G EDGE network experience excruciatingly slow data speeds, and are not able to access data while on a phone call. This in and of itself to the average user looks like an AT&T fail. All they know is they are supposed to be able to do both on AT&T’s network. AT&T and Apple told them so. They are probably only distantly aware of the difference between 2G and 3G. The only thing that really goes through the average users mind, and even my mind (though I know the cause), is, “hey, AT&T really stinks in this area!” If AT&T rolled out 3G to these areas, it would improve the perception of their service to users in said area. Not to mention the areas that are still EDGE only (the majority of the country), are less densely populated than the metro areas currently covered by 3G. So 3G service in these areas could potentially be GREAT!  
      
    
2.  Concentration is a problem. Example: as I was driving a couple days ago, as soon as I noticed my phone’s icon switch from “E” to “3G” (which was few and far between), I had my wife grab the phone and download all kinds of things that I would want to look at later on (emails, RSS feeds and so on). The point here is I waited until I was in a 3G area to do this. AT&T has concentrated an already overwhelming problem into these small areas. If 3G were more ubiquitous the load would be more spread out. Granted, there may still be problems in the metro areas, but I just have to imagine my scenario is a common scenario, which concentrates even more network traffic into these 3G areas.  
      
    
3.  Verizon. Verizon offers 3G service across the entirety of it’s considerably larger than AT&T’s service footprint with few exceptions. It’s no fun for a user (like me) to be sitting their grumbling, waiting for something to load, grumbling, holding your phone up in the air to make sure you are getting the best reception you possibly can, and did I mention grumbling?, and having a Verizon Android user’s phone running laps around you, loading all sorts of things while you are waiting for a little bit of text to load up in that EDGE only area (yeah, I’m good at run on sentences). Make no mistake, EVDO (Verizon 3G) may technically not be as capable as HSPA (AT&T 3G), but it is better executed by Verizon, and it’s EVERYWHERE.
