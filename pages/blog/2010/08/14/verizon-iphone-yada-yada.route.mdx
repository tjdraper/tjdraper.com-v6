Okay, I’m calling this one, I can’t help it. If there is a Verizon iPhone I would expect it to be in sync with the AT&T iPhone (GSM/UMTS). I go back to the PowerPC to Intel processor switch. Did we see any external differentiation? No. Frankly what would be the reason for differentiating it? I say if we do see a CDMA variant of the iPhone it will be in sync with other iPhone offerings.
