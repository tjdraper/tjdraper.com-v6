Personally, if it were my app store I wouldn’t let playboy in at all because of what it represents. Apple has placed itself in a difficult position with the app store, and it being the only officially sanctioned way to get native apps on iOS devices. From my perspective though, I applaud Apple for keeping the app store clean to the extent they have. And frankly, isn’t most porn viewed from a browser? I mean if you are going to view that filth, lack of an iOS native application is not going to keep you from doing so. I’ve had my problems with Apple’s rejection of specific apps in the past, or their asking a developer to meet certain demands, but this is certainly not one of those times!
