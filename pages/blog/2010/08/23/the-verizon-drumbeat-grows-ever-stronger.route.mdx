This is interesting,

> The current front-runner is Verizon, which is said to be in talks with Apple for a “SVDO” iPhone which would allow both voice and data at the same time, something not possible with a traditional CDMA phone on Verizon’s network.

Now, I’m still not buying any of this mind you, but if we were to see a CDMA iPhone on Verizon (in other words, pre-LTE), SVDO would be quite an interesting development. Apple has marketed 3G capable version of the iPhone (all iPhone’s after the first one) as being able to do voice and data simultaneously. Simultaneous voice and data is something CDMA based 3G networks (Verizon, Sprint) have not been able to do up till this point. Now with the SVDO upgrade to CDMA networks, voice and data at the same time could be a reality. If Apple were going with Verizon prior to widespread availability of LTE, my bet is they would really be pushing Verizon to implement SVDO on their aging CDMA network as it would keep feature parity with GSM/UMTS iPhone offerings. Apple could continue to paint with a broad brush in it’s marketing campaigns that iPhone does voice and data simultaneously over cellular networks you see (and they can just continue to ignore 2G EDGE data networks, which is what 80% of AT&T’s footprint is). It would also not be the first time a network gave an aging technology one last boost before moving on to the greener pastures of the newer technology looming on the horizon. With the first iPhone, AT&T did a lot of upgrading to the 2G EDGE network in preparation for the launch of iPhone, running more backhaul to cell sites and shifting frequency spectrums around (which, as those of us who bought the first iPhone within the first couple weeks of launch might remember, was painfully inadequate, but I digress…).

We’ll see what develops.
