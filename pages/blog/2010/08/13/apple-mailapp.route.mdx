First of all, can’t Apple rename the application?!? “Mail” is an awkward name. For example, I use “Mail” to get my mail… wait what? It’s just stupid. How about iMail? Or MacMail? Something!

Okay, sorry, I’ll get off my soapbox now. The linked article is a short and decent review of the current version of “Mail.”

I use Mail every day and like it better than any other client I’ve ever used overall. My setup is 3 IMAP accounts, I don’t use notes or to-dos. Notes lack of ability to have folders for organizing THAT SYNC is annoying. And IMAP note syncing is buggy at best. To-Dos integrate with iCal as you would expect, but STILL do not sync to the iPhone. So I use Evernote for my notes, and Toodledo for my to-dos. So really the point I’m getting at here is I only use Mail for email and I love it.

I do have a couple items on the wishlist and the biggest one is a widescreen column view. I know there are at least two plugins I have tried that accomplish this in one fashion or another but I have not been satisfied with either of them.
