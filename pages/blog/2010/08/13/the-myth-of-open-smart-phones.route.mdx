I think the question is degrees of openness (or closed-ness), not “open platform” vs. “closed platform.” Is the Android OS more open than iOS? Yes indeed it is. Is that good? That depends upon what you value in your mobile OS. For some the answer is yes, Android being more open is good. For some, the more tightly controlled experience of iOS is the better choice. At this point I’m mostly arguing and rooting for iOS.
