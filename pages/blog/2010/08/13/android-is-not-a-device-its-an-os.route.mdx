> Android is an OS, not a device. iPhone is a device, not an OS.

Hey, [that’s what I said!](/article/2010/08/ios-vs-android) It’s the whole market share thing all over again. Everyone used to love to talk about Macintosh _insert percent_ market share vs. Windows _insert gargantuan percent_ market share. But one little problem, Macintosh as a whole, is a group of computers from one manufacturer, Windows is an OS. Mac runs the Mac OS to be sure, but it’s still an Apples to Oranges comparison. Now, comparing Macintosh percentage of market share to Dell, or Acer, or HP… now that would be an Apples to Apples comparison.

The same is true when comparing iPhone and Android. iOS devices are just that, Devices from one manufacturer. Android is an OS available on many manufacturers.
