If AT&T sincerely believes loss of exclusivity will not have a huge negative impact then I think they are in for a rude awakening. As it stands right now, I would go back to Verizon in a cold minute if I could have the iPhone on Verizon. Big Red’s network quite simply smoke’s AT&T’s by years. I mean Verizon has had 3G service in my area for years and almost their entire footprint provides 3G service. Oh sure, AT&T’s 3G is “technically” better than Verizon’s, but with very rare exceptions, my side by side comparison’s always put Verizon on top. HSPA+ has the potential to smoke EVDO and yet, AT&T just can’t quite manage it.

The bottom line is AT&T’s time to convince me to stick with them when my contract is over is running out. I can’t help but believe that they will loose their exclusive on the iPhone next year, and I think it is the primary reason why AT&T is as big as they are.
