> Remember that video of Camera+ that showed the photographer pressing on the volume buttons as if they were mapped to the shutter? It turned out that was just an internal build of the app because Apple rejected the feature when tap tap tap first tried to implement it.

Unfortunately, while I am not a fan of Apple’s over burdensome “gatekeeper” approval process for iOS apps, I am also not a fan of buttons being remapped. One of the ways iPhone differs from other phones and platforms is that buttons ALWAYS perform the same, or almost identical functions. To be able to snap a picture with a volume button… is just downright unintuitive. I don’t think devs should be allowed to remap system level hardware buttons for their own purposes. I remember with one of my older phones that the volume buttons could never be counted on to be volume buttons at any given time depending on what you were doing with the phone. By contrast, my iPhone’s hardware buttons ALWAYS perform the same functions. Lock/Wake, always Locks/Wakes the phone. A single press of the home button always takes me to the springboard. Volume always controls the active volume. I don’t have to wonder what the button is going to do depending on the situation, I know what it’s going to do.
