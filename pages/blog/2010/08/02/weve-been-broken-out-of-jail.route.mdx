So iOS 4 (4.0.1) has been Jailbroken on all devices now. As a matter of fact, it’s the most painless jailbreak process I’ve seen. I’ve jailbroken iPhones in my day (though my current iPhone has never been jailbroken), and among the easier processes were [Blackra1n](http://blackra1n.com/) and [Spirit](http://spiritjb.com/). Both were click button jailbreaks, no special talents required (as opposed to some of the other jailbreak methods I used involving creating custom firmware and putting the iPhone in DFU mode). But there is an important difference with this jailbreak. Where all previous jailbreaks but one required physical access to the iPhone, this one does not. For this one, you simply load up the website [JailBreakMe.com](http://www.jailbreakme.com/) in Mobile Safari, slide the button, and the website Jailbreaks your iPhone for you. And this is great and easy, and all, but as [some](http://9to5mac.com/node/20643) [sites](http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/08/02/new-iphone-jailbreakme-com-method-allows-for-malicious-phone-access/) have [recognized](http://www.tipb.com/2010/08/02/jailbreak-exploits-maliciousness/), this is actually a very serious vulnerability in Mobile Safari. As far as I’m concerned, Jailbreaking is a fairly safe process, but suppose you visited a website designed to take advantage of this vulnerability in a devious way. It’s not hard to imaging that if the Jailbreak team can break iPhone security and install software over the internet to your phone, that just about any code of the coder’s choosing could be executed.

What I want to know is if I theoretically came across a website that jailbroke my iPhone without asking for my permission (unlike the JailbreakMe.com site which does ask permission) would Apple still [void my warranty](http://www.cultofmac.com/apples-official-response-to-dmca-jailbreak-exemption-it-voids-your-warranty/52463)?
