[Jailbreaking the iPhone @ the Apple Store →](http://www.twitvid.com/KDQOH)

Ooooooo, this is fun!

I wonder how long it will take Apple release an update and make sure all in store models are updated as well!

Also, I couldn’t tell for sure, but it looked to me like that in store model was still running the original 4.0 (not updated with the new bars).
