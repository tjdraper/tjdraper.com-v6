Net neutrality sounds like such a great thing doesn’t it? And I am for net neutrality. But I am _not_ for regulating net neutrality. I mean listen to that, it’s such an oxymoron.

Let me boil this down. I operate a home network. It is encrypted, only computers I allow are on the network. I also filter my home network via OpenDNS. I have the filter set to not allow pornographic sites and some other filth and inappropriate content on my network. It is my network and I have that right. Now let’s talk about ISPs. An ISP is basically operating a network. They charge you a fee, and for that fee they allow you to connect to their network. If they decide to filter some content, that is their right. If I don’t like it I can find a different ISP.

Personally, I think filtering content as an ISP on that level is silly, but it is their right and their service to do with as they please.
