Is the iPhone 3G becoming extinct?

In a word, yeah, it’s going extinct.

Aside from my fairly strict policy I have instituted on myself of only getting a new iPhone every 2 years when my contract allows me to do so for less money… One of the reasons I did not get the iPhone 3G is because only 2 things changed from the original iPhone. It got a GPS chip, and it got 3G networking. Everything else was the same, RAM, processor etc. And I could tell already that the original iPhone’s processor and RAM were _the_ weakest links. The original iPhone, and consequently the iPhone 3G since it used the same stuff, were both extremely underpowered. My 3GS however, is still a joy to use.
