> Your iPhone is a blank slate—a chameleon—by design. Consider what it says that there’s no Apple logo on the front of your iPhone: **Respectful.** “You and your content are important.” **Tasteful.** “Why mar an elegant design with logos. And how does that help you?” **Determined.** “Hey, your carrier’s logo didn’t just not appear there all by itself.” **Confident.** “You’ll recognize it’s ours even without the logo.” Now, consider what it says when a competitor slaps a prominent logo on the front of their device: **Disrespectful.** “We’re important. You take second place.” **Tasteless.** “The logo stays, period.” **Timid.** “Sure, we’re happy to put your carrier logo on there, too!” **Unconfident.** “Without the logo, how will you know who made it?”

I couldn’t agree more!
