It’s fun to see that an Apple Keyboard of 20 years is still functioning, and recognized easily by OS X even with the ADB to USB adapter. Also, I completely understand the sentiment of using a particular keyboard (and mouse in my case). Though newer, I have a specific keyboard and mouse that I use that I find increases my productivity. Anything else feels foreign.
