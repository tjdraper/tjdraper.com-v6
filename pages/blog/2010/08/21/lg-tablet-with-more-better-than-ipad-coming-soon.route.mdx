> Mr. Ma said that the iPad is a great device, but he doesn’t do much work on it. “Our tablet will be better than the iPad.”

So let me get this straight. The tablet LG releases will be better than the already released iPad? If LG is so full of good ideas, why didn’t they just release a tablet before Apple and just nip that competition in the bud? Give me a break.

[This Dilbert Comic](http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/2009-12-09/) strip seems apropos.
