  9to5 Mac: Vimeo Now Has an HTML5 Heart, Sorry Flash

Vimeo just got a whole lot more useful as far as I’m concerned. I hate flash so much I avoid it whenever possible. I have been using Vimeo’s HTML5 player on their site for a while, but embeds have continued to be flash only. This will be useful for me as an easy way to embed HTML5 video on the internet, my other blogs etc (though I don’t have an imidiate use for it here on Apple User Pro since thus far my decision has been to not include media). The sooner flash goes away completely the happier I will be with the state of the internet!
