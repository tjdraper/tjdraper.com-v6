> On top of every BlackBerry, there’s a little sliver of a red light, and it blinks at you when a new message or call comes in. People get seriously addicted to that light, Michaluk said. “You put a blinking red light on a device, and when that light blinks, you jump,” he said. “It’s Pavlovian training, right? For me, really, it’s my connection to my people. And second, it’s my connection to the world in terms of news and everything.” He added: “It’s one of those things that always calls you back to your BlackBerry.” Of course, other phones have ways of alerting people to new messages, too, but none has the same feel as that BlackBerry light, users said.

This is given as a reason why people still use a Blackberry? Seriously? SERIOUSLY?!?
