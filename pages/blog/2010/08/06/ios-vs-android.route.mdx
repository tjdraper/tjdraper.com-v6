So the numbers say that Android and iOS are neck and neck in the race. I’ve seen some numbers claiming Android is now outselling iOS. But there’s an important note to make here. Like the Windows vs. Mac comparison, Android vs. iOS is a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. Android is a software platform not designed for any specific device but instead runs on multiple hardware platforms. iOS on the other hand is Apple’s mobile operating system for iPhone. It’s a very clearly focused platform in which hardware and software are made to work very closely together.

Considering that Android is available on multiple devices and multiple carriers, it’s not surprising to me that it is doing so well. In my opinion, if you can’t or won’t use AT&T, an Android device is a viable alternative. Maybe not quite as good as the iPhone in some ways (maybe a little better in others), but none the less a workable alternative. What is surprising is that iPhone is holding it’s own in this lopsided battle. One hardware platform, one dismally inept carrier. This should tell us something.

I believe if Apple would go multi-carrier, make a Verizon/Sprint compatible version of the iPhone, and add T-Mobile’s 3G frequency to the GSM/UMTS iPhone, they could trounce Android.
