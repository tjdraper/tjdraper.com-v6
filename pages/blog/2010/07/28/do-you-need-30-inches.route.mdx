So Adam Jackson over at The Apple Blog wants to know where Apple’s 30” display is. They discontinued their previous 30” Cinema display some time ago. But I have had a chance to use the older 30” model and in my opinion is is simply too big. It’s hard to explain, but it just feels like all I’m doing is running my mouse around the screen trying to find stuff. I use two 24” monitors side by side everyday and to me, that is a much preferred arrangement. I have also talked to a lot of people that feel the same way so I think it’s possible Apple just didn’t see enough demand for the 30”. I’m also not convinced that 27” is not too big but I haven’t used anything of the 27” variety so I will withhold judgement. But I am fairly partial to the 2-24” arrangement I have at work every day.

I also disagree with the assessment that other manufacturers monitors use the same panels and are just as good. A couple years ago I was convinced to buy 2 Dell monitors for work that supposedly have the same LCD panels and all the same specs as the Apple Cinema displays of that same era, which we were making use of at the time. Well let me tell you, those Dells just aren’t as good as the Apple Cinema displays. They lack the contrast, clarity and vibrance of the Apple Cinema displays on the other desk.
