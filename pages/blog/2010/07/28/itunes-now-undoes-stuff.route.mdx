iTunesâ€™ lack of undo when accidentally deleting an item, or worse items, has always been frustrating to me. I had actually just noticed yesterday undo was working as you would expect it to when I used Command+Z by force of habit and was pleasantly surprised to see my song reappear in the playlist.
