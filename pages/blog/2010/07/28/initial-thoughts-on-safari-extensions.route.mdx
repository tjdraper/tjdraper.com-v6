[Safari Extensions Gallery →](http://extensions.apple.com/)

Wait, you can’t search extensions? What on earth???

Seriously! The first thing I tried to do was search for some extensions. So I started hunting around for the extensions search field. Then I started going, “Hey, where’s the search at?” And that’s when I started realizing that there is no search for all these extensions (remember iPhone OS 1 where there was no search in the contacts? Yeah… it kinda reminds me a little of that. I’m still shuddering at the nightmare being reminded of THAT caused!).

So then I tried the Apple Website generic search field up at the top right of the Apple Website. I started by searching for an extension that I knew to exist in the extensions gallery to see if the Apple Website generic search would search Safari Extensions… It doesn’t.

FAIL!

But moving on from that.

Being the geek that I am, I have been using Safari Extensions since Safari 5 came out. It wasn’t that hard to enable extensions, and several websites cropped up pretty quickly for Safari Extensions in the temporary absence of the official extensions gallery. However, I have noted that some of the extensions I am using are not available in the gallery (yet). But that could be because the developers just haven’t submitted them yet. We shall see.

Here are some of the Extensions I have been using:

**[AdBlock](http://safariadblock.com/)**

Yes I’m one of those evil geeks that tries to block obnoxious adds!

**[Invisible Status Bar](http://dbergey.github.com/)**

I really liked this about Chrome, and in Safari I always before had the status bar enabled. Always sitting at the bottom of the browser taking up space. This is much better!

**[GReader](http://rafeed.me/safari-extensions/)**

Sits in the Safari Tool Bar and tells me how many unread RSS feeds I have in Google Reader.

**[FullScreenYouTube](http://www.cyberhq.nl/)**

This is for YouTube’s HTML5 beta that “doesn’t support” full screen right now, but actually works for any HTML5 video I’ve seen so far, including Vimeo. It will let you make HTML5 video go full screen. It’s quite handy.

**[JavaScript Blacklist](http://homepage.mac.com/drewthaler/jsblacklist/)**

This is one of the better plugins I use! I really hate it when random words turn into links on a webpage, or text is inserted into a copy function, copying more than selected into my clipboard. I am currently blocking scripts from tynt.com, intellitxt.com and snap.com, which is the default.

**[Google Reader Compact](http://pedrocc.com/safari)**

Has a couple of minor cosmetic defects, but I like it because it takes better advantage of my screen real-estate.

**And One More**

There is one more thing I use on Safari, but it is not an officially sanctioned extension. In fact, it doesn’t install as a Safari Extension. It has a regular old OS X installer package. And I’ve been using it for quite a while (well before Safari 5), and I find it essential. It is [ClickToFlash](http://clicktoflash.com/). This plugin does not allow any flash to load on a page until I specifically click on it. Unfortunately blocking flash entirely still isn’t completely possible, so being able to load it on click is a great option to have! And I can add specific site to the whitelist as well. This literally revolutionized my web browsing experience.
