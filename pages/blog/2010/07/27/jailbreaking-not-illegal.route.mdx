So I’m a little late to this party since I’m just getting Apple User Pro started, but as you probably already know, Jailbreaking has been declared “okay” by the U.S. Copyright gurus. This to me is great news, even though I don’t jailbreak anymore. What some people have misunderstood however, is what this means for their warranty. Apple still has every right to void your warranty for installing modified iOS software on your iOS device. They have explicitly stated such in their E.U.L.A. To me it’s like modifying the engine in your new car, then complaining when it breaks that the dealer won’t honor the warranty.

All the Copyright Office is saying is that you can’t go to jail for “modifying your engine.” There is no way (as there shouldn’t be) that they can force Apple to provide warranty for your unauthorized tinkering.
