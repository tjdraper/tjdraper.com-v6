You know, I actually did think Ballmer may be the worst tech CEO in history, but I stand corrected. Dellâ€™s record speaks for itself! Maybe Mr. Dell should [shut down the company and give the money back to the shareholders!](http://news.cnet.com/Dell-Apple-should-close-shop/2100-1001_3-203937.html)
