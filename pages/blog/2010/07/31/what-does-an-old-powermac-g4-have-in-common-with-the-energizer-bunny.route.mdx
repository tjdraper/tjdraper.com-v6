You know, we still have one of these at the office where I work. It’s about eight years old. It’s our network fileserver now. It doesn’t technically support Leopard (10.5), but I’ve got it running Leopard just fine. We have two large external FireWire hard drives connected to it, one for actually storing the files on the network, and one for Time Machine Backups of the file storage drive. Trying using a PC in any capacity that’s eight years old!
