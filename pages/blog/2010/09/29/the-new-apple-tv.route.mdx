While I have not used the new Apple TV, and have barely used the old one, I do like to keep up with things. In that spirit, this seems like a fair review of the device.

My problem with the Apple TV was not solved at all with the new version, but made worse. I use a Mac Mini as a media center because I have a very extensive library of content. I need to be able to manage it and have it be self contained. The old Apple TV was a sync deal, you sync content from your iTunes library to it. This Apple TV streams only, so my problem wasnâ€™t solved in any way.

You know what I wish? I wish Apple would beef up the OS X Front Row experience to match the new Apple TV, only with provision and allowance for localy stored media. Ahh well, what I have is working fine.
