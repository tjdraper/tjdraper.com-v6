9to5’s source site, Hardmac is notoriously unreliable so I’m taking this with a rather large grain of salt. Still it sounds plausible. Apple’s first love these days is iOS. As a professional Final Cut Studio user I do hope to see continued development and support for Final Cut Studio. We shall see.
