Let me start right up front by saying 9-11 was bad. In fact, it was really bad. I really do mourn with those who lost loved ones. I’m not going to argue who’s fault it was, what we could have done to prevent it, etc. etc. However what I am about to say may be offensive to some, but I think it needs to be said. So before I say it I just want to make it clear. I think 9-11 was a very real tragedy, and it is indeed something to be mourned, to be remembered, even something to bring some patriotic spirit out in us. And it has indeed done such to me today. It was after all, my country that was attacked.

However, as I considered 9-11 today, I remembered something else. A tragedy, no less real, occurs in America every single day. It is a tragedy of murder! But more than that, if I may speak collectively for a moment, this is not a tragedy that has come upon us at the hands of terrorists or any other third party. This tragedy is being perpetrated by us. Yes, you read that correctly, it is being perpetrated by us. The statistic I saw (and I don’t know if it’s accurate or not, but it’s really not the point) was that 3,700 babies are murdered each and every day in this once great country while we stand by. In fact many of us condone it, some vehemently so, championing women’s rights and all that. But the fact of the matter is that, overshadowing the mourning of 9-11 for me today, is this holocaust, this wholesale slaughter of little human beings who can’t even speak up to defend themselves.

So if we want to be really patriotic today, let’s remember, and then do something about this tragedy that is far greater than 9-11. While all the conservatives are getting all fired up about fiscal things right now (and well they should), it seems that we’ve become comfortable with this holocaust because it’s not affecting us, or so we think. I hear far more talk about rights, freedoms, national debt, “those stupid liberal democrats,” and the president’s vacations than I do about this very important issue, one that I believe is more important than our own rights and freedoms.

So you know what I have done about it? There’s not much I can do other than using my voice, which I have done and will continue to do. And I’ve stood and held signs in protest. All these things I have done. But what I am really doing is this; I have pledged to myself, and I’ve made it known to others, that I will never knowingly vote for anyone who is for abortion, or who will not oppose abortion at every chance they get. That is the first and most important consideration when I look at a candidate for any political office, I don’t care what that office is, local, state, national.

So that’s what 9-11 ultimately did for me today, is it led me to remember the real tragedy and renew my vow to make it the most important issue above my own rights and liberties.
