This is in line with what I have been saying. I just don’t think that Apple thinks it makes sense to build a CDMA iPhone when everything is going LTE. Even a couple years ago it might have made sense, but Apple was locked in to an exclusive with AT&T. As bad as AT&T may be, they did choose the right technology. Not only is UMTS better from a technical standpoint, but it is also the world technology so it made sense for Apple (and it really is the better technology, it’s just that AT&T is too inept to deploy it properly). I really wonder if some of the thought at Apple was the same as my thinking when I decided I could switch to AT&T, “Well, how bad could they be really? I mean they are a national carrier, and number 2 in subscribers right?” I don’t think Apple realized just how inept AT&T would be. I could be wrong, maybe Apple at the time felt like they had no choice, and they have talked about the advantages of the exclusive partnership (I’m sure there were some at first). Who knows for sure right?

So to re-affirm my postion, I think there’s a high probablity we will see iPhone on T-Mobile next year if indeed the exclusive contract with AT&T is over. T-Mobile’s GSM/UMTS technology is compatible with the iPhone, the only possible issue is T-Mo’s weird 3G frequencies, but they aren’t the only carrier in the world that uses these frequencies, and there has been some speculation that the current iPhone may even have support for the 1700/2100 MHz band. No one has been able to say definitively that the iPhone 4 does/or does not have the 1700/2100 band.

I do not think we will see a CDMA iPhone for Verizon (or Sprint). Ever. I do think in 2013 or 2014 we will see an LTE iPhone on Verizon and AT&T. That’s my opinion.

Now, it’s hard to speculate very far into the future, but I know one thing for sure. Apple really doesn’t want to split the platform. But it’s going to get harder as the ineptness of AT&T continues. You see, here’s the rub with AT&T, their entire footprint is based on GSM (2G technology). 3G-UMTS comprises a very small overlay of that footprint, and in no place have they turned off their GSM network (which is a good thing because even in 3G areas I fall back to GSM half the time). So here’s the problem. For AT&T and Verizon, and most of the rest of the world, the chosen upgrade path for 4G is LTE. AT&T has announced that they will be serving up LTE in a few markets starting next year. And they still haven’t deployed their 3G network across their entire network footprint. In fact, as I have stated, they only cover a very small portion of their footprint with 3G. So what that means is that for some time to come, a 4G phone on AT&T would have to support 3 network technologies in order to be worth anything. It will most certainly take some time for AT&T to even cover their current 3G areas with 4G-LTE, so the phone would need 3G to fall back on in those areas. And it would need GSM to fall back on in the areas AT&T just doesn’t care about (my home area for instance). AT&T really has themselves in a jam as far as I’m concerned. It’s really a mess!

Meanwhile, Verizon is talking about having their LTE network complete by 2014 (how long has AT&T been “working” on “deploying” their 3G network?). It will certainly be interesting to watch this play out.
