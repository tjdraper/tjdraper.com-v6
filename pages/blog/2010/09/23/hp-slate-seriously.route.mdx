Okay, I mean really! This guy keeps saying it’s fast, while he can’t even get it to scroll! And a mouse cursor on a touch screen? What’s the point? And I have to push a button to bring up the keyboard? Why can’t the keyboard be smart enough to come up when needed. There are [other](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) [devices](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) that have this figured out!

Oh, and a Control+Alt+Delete button? Seriously? I’m sorry, that thing is just LAME!
