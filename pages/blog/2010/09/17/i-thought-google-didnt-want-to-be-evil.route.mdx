I love the picture on this article! It’s not like Mr. Schmidt needed help looking creepy! But that aside, it is interesting to watch Google’s transformation. I used to like Google a lot more than I do. There are still some things I like about Google, but they do seem to be loosing their “Don’t be evil” ways.
