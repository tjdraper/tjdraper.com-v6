This is just stupid. How do you advertise a feature that was never in the device? I mean it’s not like they wouldn’t have known for quite a while now. The silly thing had to be manufactured before it was sold.

Also, a trend I’ve noticed with Apple this go around of updates, is to exclude features to make the device smaller. I mean look at the Nano! There is such a thing as too small. I actually like the size of my iPhone 3GS very much. Anytime I’ve used an iPod Touch, it was actually awkward to hold. As far as I’m concerned, there’s plenty of room to make it just a bit bigger if they just couldn’t fit the vibration motor in it.
