All Gruber’s observations are spot on as usual, but here’s a couple in particular:

On the iPod Touch

> It has a high resolution 960 × 640 display, but it isn’t using IPS LED technology. It’s a good-looking display, but it doesn’t look as good as the iPhone 4’s. The iPhone 4 tech specs page claims an 800:1 contrast ratio and an oleophobic coating; the iPod Touch tech specs page mentions neither of those.

The iPod Touch is a bit of an embarrassment this time around, I mean really!

And then there’s the Nano.

> Having played with the new Nano today in an Apple Store, it feels much more like a Shuffle with a touchscreen than a replacement for the previous Nano.

It feels like to me that Apple now has two iPod Shuffles, a lower end model, and a higher end model, and the nano no longer exists. Ahh well.

> **THE WHITE IPHONE 4** Not even mentioned, let alone shipped. Embarrassing.

Embarrassing is right!
