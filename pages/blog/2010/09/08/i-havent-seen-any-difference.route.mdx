Note dear old Seth, the blogger guy (what a stupid tagline eh?) says this stuff is happening all over the country to AT&T’s network. It’s funny, I can’t really tell it. I took a trip just a couple weeks ago, and the primary coverage was 2G, EDGE. I can liken my experience to finding the occasional oasis of 3G in a desert of EDGE. And just yesterday, I dropped a call right in the middle of Franklin, TN 3G coverage. I get lousy in building coverage with AT&T anywhere I am.

I used to defend AT&T, but I’ve given up. I have grown to hate AT&T. It is a fetter around my iPhone’s proverbial neck!
