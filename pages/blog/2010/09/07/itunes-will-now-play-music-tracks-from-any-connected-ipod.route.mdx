This has actually been present since one of the later releases of iTunes 9, but it’s worth noting. There have been many times when I was wearing headphones at work, which I could pipe my iPod’s music through those headphones as well. It’s always been sort of odd to me that an automatically managed iPod would not let you play songs via iTunes but a manually managed iPod would. And now it’s all better!
