> At 220 pixels per inch (PPI), the new nano’s screen is clear and easy to read—it has a higher pixel density than the screen on any iPod except the latest iPod touch. But the tiny size of that screen means Apple has had to take creative license with the iOS-style interface. For example, whereas most multi-screen iPhone apps feature navigation buttons at the top or bottom of the screen, there’s no room for such niceties on the nano. Instead, you usually switch screens by swiping the screen to the left or right. This is simple enough, but it’s not always clear when the gesture will work. For example, when viewing the Songs list, will swiping to the right take you back up to the home screen? (Answer: yes, but you only know this if you happened to have tried it previously.) Throughout the interface, the fact that there’s rarely a visual indication of when you can or can’t swipe means that you end up swiping to the left and right on every screen to see if anything happens.

> The big question, for me, is why the nano’s screen had to be so small. Given the existence of the iPod shuffle, there doesn’t seem to have been a compelling need for another as-small-as-we-can-make-it iPod, and a slightly larger design would have allowed for a larger screen. For example, a rectangular nano—perhaps the same width, just a bit longer, with a screen similar in size to that of the 5G nano—would have been considerably more useful, allowing you to view at least five items on the screen at a time, instead of three and a half, perhaps with enough room left over for more onscreen navigational aids. Of course, battery life would suffer a bit with a larger touchscreen, but the nano’s battery life is impressive enough that losing a few hours of playback time would be an acceptable compromise for many users.

The review certainly isn’t all negative, and it’s worth the read. However, let’s just say that this “evolution” of the nano (and I use the word evolution in quotes because I’m not sure evolution is appropriate), leaves me scratching my head. Why would we want a product to loose features? And yeah, touchscreens are great, but I don’t think we need touchscreens on _every_ device! The missing physical controls for a dedicated media player absolutely baffle me.
