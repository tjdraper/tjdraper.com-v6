> OS X 10.6 is the cherry atop the lovely sundae that is Apple’s latest operating system. It’s a fond farewell to a cat that’s grown rather long in the tooth, and I don’t think we’ll see a 10.7 in the series.

What a sensationalist load of garbage. Beside the fact that as it stands right now iOS would never work well on a full size computer, there is the fact that you have to have a Mac running Snow Leopard to develop for iOS. If Apple let’s the Mac platform stagnate, it’s iOS platform will also stagnate.

Now, I do believe we will see iOS and Full Grown OS X grow closer together. They are both built on the same foundation of the Mach Micro Kernel and I expect many of the deeper level changes to one are very nearly compatible to the other. But beyond that, I think Apple will “borrow” from itself as it continues to build out each OS. Will we eventually see a merger, or iOS takeover for all devices. It’s possible, but it’s a ways away. I fully believe we will indeed see a 10.7, and even a 10.8. I could not speculate at this time what they will look like, and how much of the iOS feel OS X will take on, but there’s way too much going on with the full grown OS X platform to abandon it any time soon.
