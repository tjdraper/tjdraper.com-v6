Today marks the day that OS X Public Beta was realeased to the public. Apple was just coming out of it’s own little dark ages. A lot of folks didn’t like OS X at the time, and it did have it’s problems in those days. But as Apple knew then, and we all know now the potential of OS X was there. And in fact OS X turned out to be Apple’s saving grace. Apple would not be where it is today, might even be bankrupt if not for OS X. Without OS X we would not have the modern Macintosh. Without OS X we would not have iPhones and iPod Touches. Hey, even you PC users, I doubt very much you would have Windows 7 as it exists today without OS X spurring on the advancement of the modern operating system.

Macworld.com has a couple of great articles up today about OS X and looking back:
