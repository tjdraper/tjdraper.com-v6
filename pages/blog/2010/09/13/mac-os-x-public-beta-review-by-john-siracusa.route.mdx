This is a re-run of the original review. I read it once a few years ago. After I switched to Mac and started getting all geeky about it, I played catchup. Ever since then, I always read John’s reviews of the OS when a new version comes out. He’s thorough, but good.

One interesting tidbit I picked up from my quick skim just now, OS X Public Beta took up a whopping 800 MB. How far we’ve come!
