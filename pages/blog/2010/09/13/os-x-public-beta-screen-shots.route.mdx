Since this is the tenth anniversary of the release of OS X Public Beta I was looking at screenshots of said version of OS X (that was before it got [Fireballed!](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/13/mac-os-x-public-beta) I suspect it will be back, which is why I am linking to it anyway). Anyone remember those awful pinstripes? They were EVERYWHERE! Ugh! OS X looks so much better today. And how about that Finder? Who says Finder hasn’t improved?

But you know what’s funny? I don’t think there’s a single element in the screenshots of OS X Public Beta that has not evolved or changed in some way, and yet it is still very recognizable as OS X. Weird, that.
