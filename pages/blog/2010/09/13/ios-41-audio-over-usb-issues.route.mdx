I am SO glad someone else finally noticed this! I’ve been having this problem since I got my hands on the Gold Master before the official release. I have a Pioneer audio system in my car that is compatible with my iPhone via USB/Dock Connector. I’ve switched to using the line in port because sound issues over USB are so bad! It’s a pain though because I have to connect two cables to my iPhone when I get in my car instead of one.
