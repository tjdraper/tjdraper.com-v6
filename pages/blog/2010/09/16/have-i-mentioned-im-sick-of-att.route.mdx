  Have I mentioned I'm sick of AT&T?

So I had an appointment to work on someone’s computer yesterday (a Windows Vista box, but that’s another story), and I get out there and I have a 2 to 3 bar fluctuating 3G signal on my iPhone. 2 to 3 bars is workable, though it seems a little odd to me because I’m right smack in the middle of solid blue 3G coverage on AT&T’s coverage maps…

And then I walked into the house…

Signal was almost nill, most of the time my phone stayed on 2G inside the house. While I was waiting on an operation I was performing on this computer, I looked up my location on AT&T’s maps again. Yep, solid blue 3G coverage. Pretty pathetic.

But then to top it off, I noticed my client had a Droid (Verizon of course) and I asked how Verizon did out here. She showed me that she had full signal 3G coverage, right next to my phone which had one measly bar of EDGE. Said Verizon is always rock solid out here.

Dear Apple, can we please get over the AT&T addiction in the U.S.? Thanks!
