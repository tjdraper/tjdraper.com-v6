All I can say is, it’s about time! I have hated the Marker Felt font in the notes app since the day I got my first iPhone. In fact for that, and other reasons (not the least of which are syncing and proper organization) I have completely abandoned the built in notes app anyway, so it really doesn’t matter. But hooray for a professional font choice in any event!
