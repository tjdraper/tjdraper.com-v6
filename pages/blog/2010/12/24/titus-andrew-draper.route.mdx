Yeah, so I’m a little late posting this on my blog, but I’ve been really busy. See, I didn’t sleep at all Sunday night, what with staying up all night. So Monday was mostly sleeping and stuff. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday I had to get back in to work to meet deadlines.

I know, blah blah blah, right?

So anyway, Titus Andrew was born at 2:33 AM on December 20. He weighted six pounds, eight ounces and measured 20 inches long.
