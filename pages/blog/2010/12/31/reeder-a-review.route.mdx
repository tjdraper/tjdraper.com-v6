[Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) is perhaps one of the best app purchases I’ve ever made for my iPhone at just $2.99 ([available on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8)). I’ve tried a number of RSS apps that sync with Google Reader, and even tried using just the web app in Safari. None of them hold a candle to Reeder. But I actually discovered Reeder by trying the Mac beta a few weeks back and I was hooked.

Since the Macintosh application is where I started that’s where I will start the review ([link to the beta](http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder)).

First of all, I think web applications can be good, and Google Reader on the web is one of the best. But in my experience there just aren’t any web apps that do as good a job as a platform native application for anything where such an app exists. And I’m glad the Google Reader web interface exists, I still use it. But I use it much less now that I have Reeder.

First, Reeder for Mac syncs everything with Google Reader. Folders, Subscriptions, Shared Items, Starred Items, everything. The three position button slider at the top allows me to switch between three basic “view filters” as I’m calling them here. Starred Items, Unread Items, and All Items (read, unread, or starred). And the beauty of this over the web interface is that even in the Starred view, items are still shown in folders and feeds. This took care of a major gripe I had with Google Reader and Starred items. I could not before view my starred items by feed and folder.

Secondly, Reeder for Mac uses all the same keyboard shortcuts that I used in the Google Reader web interface. “S” for starring an item, “K” to page up to the next item, “V” to open an item, and “J” to page down to the previous item. I think there are other keyboard shortcuts that it shares with Reader on the web, but those are really the only four I ever use(d).

While I’m here on keyboard shortcuts, it should be noted that using the “V” shortcut, or clicking on links opens them right in the Reeder application which can be nice. However, Reeder does have one other shortcut that I use a lot, maybe even more than “V” and that is “B” to open the item in your default browser. You can set in the preferences for links opened in the browser to open in the background, which setting I have activated. This is nice because you can open an item and keep right on going through your feeds until you are ready to switch to Safari and take a look at the item you opened.

Third is integrated sharing. There are no other app I have used that gets this right. You can share, or share with note right through Reeder’s slick interface, and you can see your friends shared items, and who shared it, and whatever note they may have shared it with.

Fourth, Starred Items and folders/feeds. I’ve already mentioned this, but it’s so good it’s worth mentioning again. You see, a lot of times I’m just trying to get through my feeds quickly while I have 5 minutes or something. I like to keep my reading list marked as read so that it’s more manageable. A lot of times the way I do this is simply add a star to items of interest so I can come back and read it later, marking everything else as read (because it’s boring or whatever). One thing I always abhorred though is that all my sorting of feeds into folders, and even just viewing by feed was lost when it came to Starred Items, because the only place in Google Reader that you could view you Starred Items was in the single Starred Items tag over on the left side of Google Reader. This just shows you ALL your starred items in one big list. Well Reeder lets you view starred items per folder and Feed, even viewing only Starred Items that you have starred from Friend’s Shared Items. It is probably the coolest feature of Reeder in my opinion.

Reeder for Mac is still beta and a few things are missing, such as feed management. I still have to visit the web interface of Google Reader to manage my feeds. But I don’t have to do this very often so no big deal. And I do occasionally observe a temporary application “hang” when click to a feed that contains a flash video. Other than that Reeder really doesn’t feel like a beta to me.

So after spending a couple weeks with Reeder for Mac I realized that I needed the iPhone app. And I have been most impressed. Reeder for iPhone does everything that Reeder for Mac does, only formatted for iPhone. Of course it doesn’t utilize keyboard shortcuts as the iPhone has no physical keyboard, but it has a nice little services menu invoked at the bottom right side of Reeder for iPhone that is completely customizable. You can choose what you want to see in the services menu.

And it does indeed behave the same as it’s big beta brother in terms of syncing, folders, feeds, and Starred Items.

I am very happy with Reeder and will gladly pay a small fee for the Mac application when it leaves beta, provided that fee is reasonable. And it certainly strikes me as just the type of application we may see in the Mac App store.
