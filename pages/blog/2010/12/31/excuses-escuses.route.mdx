Yes, excuses, I’ve got them… I got too busy and didn’t have time to keep up with this blog. I had a baby (well, my wife did actually). I had an insane deadline on a project. You see, I’ve got all kinds of excuses.

I don’t really like new year resolutions, but I’ve more or less resolved to try to perhaps make a bit of an effort to post stuff here. My professional (and otherwise) opinions!

Also, maybe I should look for one or two professional(ish) Apple enthusiasts who would be willing to do some writing on here for free. That might be helpful.
