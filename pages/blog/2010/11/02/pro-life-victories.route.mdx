I do not put my faith or trust in politics. I know that God is sovereign over all. I know Americans are fickle. I know Republicans are not much better than Democrats.

Still, I’m encouraged by several Pro-Life wins tonight!

If my information is correct, here is the list of pro-life wins.

> Alabama: Robert Bentley (pick-up)  
> Arizona: Jan Brewer (re-election)  
> Georgia: Nathan Deal (replaced Sonny Purdue)  
> Iowa: Terry Branstadt (pick-up)  
> Kansas: Sam Brownback (pick-up)  
> Michigan: Rick Snyder (pick-up)  
> Nebraska: Dave Heineman (re-election)  
> New Mexico: Susana Martinez (pick-up)  
> Ohio: John Kasich (pick-up)  
> Oklahoma: Mary Fallin (pick-up)  
> Pennsylvania: Tom Corbett (pick-up)  
> South Carolina: Nikki Haley (replaced Mark Sanford)  
> Tennessee: Bill Haslam (pick-up)  
> Texas: Rick Perry (re-election)  
> Wisconsin: Scott Walker (pick-up)  
> Wyoming: Matt Mead (pick-up)

I figured Bill Haslam would win here in Tennessee, but it is still nice to see it for sure. He’s not perfect by any means, but he is pro-life, and that is the number one issue on which I vote. He also has a good track record in Knoxville on economic issues. As far as I’m concerned, his stance on education leaves a lot to be desired. But when you believe as I do that government funded education should be eliminated, well, it’s hard to find anyone (much less any candidate) to vote for on that issue. Suffice it to say I’ll take what I can get after determining whether I can vote for someone based on their stance on life.
