> While T-Mobile is the latest carrier to fall under the microscope, it has just as much of a right to call HSPA+ “4G” as other carriers do to call WiMAX or LTE “4G”. WiMAX is faster than EVDO — 3G — so it is called 4G. HSPA+ (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access) is faster than T-Mobile’s older HSPA network — 3G — so it is called 4G. What’s funny is that when T-Mobile finally does launch an LTE network, it could potentially use the same logic carriers use now and call it a 5G network. Yes, it would use the same technology as AT&T and Verizon Wireless’ 4G networks, but it would be 5G. This scenario sounds ridiculous — but it’s actually happening right now. AT&T has an HSPA+ network just like T-Mobile, but AT&T calls it 3G while T-Mobile calls it 4G.

This whole things is marketing. What the carriers really mean by 4G is, “faster then what we had before.” Nobody is really paying attention to the official standard of 4G. And it is also a problem of how to communicate with customers. The only network standards that will actually meet 4G requirements are a ways off and carriers need ways to compete and make their networks faster and better now. But you can’t just tell the customer, “yeah, it’s still 3G, but it’s better 3G.” No, you have to have something more flashy, more marketable. And so, since this is a new generation of networks, and we have had 3 before, this is then 4G.

However, I do think T-Mobile is really pushing it with calling their HSPA+ network 4G. But since they have no official 4G strategy (until now that is), I suppose they were feeling a bit of pressure.
