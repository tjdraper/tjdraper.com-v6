I made a prayer request yesterday morning at my Church’s prayer time that the healthcare bill would fail, and then we prayed to that end.

The answer God gave in the form of the bill being passed last night was not the one I wanted, but as I am reminding myself, it is the right answer. The passing of this healthcare bill has not taken God by surprise. He is still sovereign over all.

I am reminded of Psalm 2,

> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, \[saying\], let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

Let us remember that our salvation is not in the Oval Office, or the Senate, or the House of Representatives (and thank God for that!). Our salvation is in the Lord, and it is on Him that we trust. I do not know how this fits into God’s plan but it is enough for me to know that it does.

May the Lord’s Name be praised!
