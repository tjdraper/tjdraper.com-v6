Yeah, this is going to be a lame post just to say that I’ve updated some stuff about the site and therefore have now “almost” finished the clean up from the changeover to the 3.0 design.

Here’s the changes:

-   Added my 4 latest tweets from Twitter to the sidebar.
  
-   Updated the about page with current information. Including some subtle changes to some of the text to make the theology section more clear.

Yes, I know I still need to actually do the portfolio page. I’ll get to it… eventually…
