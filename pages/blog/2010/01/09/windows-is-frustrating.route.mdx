Man is Windows frustrating. I’ve been working on websites this evening and since 80% of the world uses IE on Windows I must resign myself to testing sites on IE for Windows.

Well anyway, Windows started nagging me about an update while I was in the middle of working. It was annoying too because I had all my browsers and different various windows just where I wanted them and this nag window would pop up right over them while I was doing something. It had a little progress bar and said that Windows would automatically restart in 10 minutes if I did nothing. And it had buttons to restart now or ignore till later. To make a long story longer, I clicked restart later. I didn’t want to bother with restarting since Windows take approximately 3.5 years to restart.

Well 5 minutes later up popped the dialog again. “Now that’s frustrating,” I thought to myself. “Didn’t I just tell this infernal thing I would restart later?” So I clicked later… AGAIN! Well apparently Windows thought it misunderstood me the first 2 times because it did it again. And again. And again.

After a total of 5 times it finally won. You see that last time I was busy doing something else and so ignored it for the 10 minutes it needed. But you know what’s frustrating? I was just clicking over into Windows to test some code I just wrote and it was shutting down.

I gotta tell you I was unimpressed! I told that silly thing 5 TIMES I did not want to restart right now. When an update pops up on Mac OS X, and you tell it later that’s the end of it. It realizes that, “hey, he meant what he said when he said later. To ask again would be interrupting his work.” Not to mention, automatically restarting after I clicked later?!? That’s out of the question!

So yeah, I was just reminded in a small way why I do not put up with the troubles that 80% or so of the rest of the world puts up with.

Windows always makes me appreciate my Mac!
