Welcome to the 3.0 design of TJDraper.com! You will find things have been cleaned up in general. And with the two pillar side bars instead of just one, there is less scrolling to see everything in the sidebars. The Sidebar on the left is for blog utility related items like Recent Posts, Categories, Monthly Archives etc. The sidebar on the left is for stuff I want to put there, like site info, blog roll etc.

Also, for those who care, the core coding will validate, and all CSS validates with the W3C validator. You will run into some archive pages that won’t validate simply because a picture I posted a while back didn’t have the alt= attribute assigned to the img tag.

This is also my first website that **will not work** in IE 6. But that’s okay because it’s very hard to write code that works in modern browsers _and_ validates, as well as works in IE6. So if any of my readers are still using IE6 I urge you to upgrade, preferably crossgrade even to [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/).

So not only have my ninja skills improved for writing code that validates, but my speed has also improved. I did this re-design in 6 hours. Granted I based the graphic design off the previous look so I didn’t sit around too much racking my brain for color schemes and stuff, and I did recycle (copy and paste) some of the Expression Engine specific code that makes the blog work. But still, it only took me 6 hours.

Me Happy! ![grin](grin.gif)
