> Professing Christians who voted for Obama were either confusedly or rebelliously heaping up judgment for all of us. Christians on the right who voted for Romney for no other reason than that he was "electable" found out that he was not as electable as all that. And Christians who voted for absolute ideological purity (which is, remember, a form of impurity) found out that that kind of purity wasn't in the running.

Exactly, so much for being "electable". Turns out he wasn't actually.

> If you want this conservative to vote with you, stop trying to entice me with non-conservatives. Stop trying to feed bacon to your horse. One of the numbing numbers to come out of this fiasco is the fact that if Romney had simply gotten the same number of votes that McCain did, Romney would have won. This deflation happened without a robust third party candidate siphoning off a large number of votes. The results of this election should not cause us to think we need to "move to the center." Two establishment Republican candidates in a row have gone down, and this second time the centrist _lost to a failed presidency_. I mean, think about it.

I mean, right? If you are the conservative party, and that party over there is the liberal party, what good does it do to try to emulate the liberal party and have liberal candidates? Who is it you think youare enticing? Not the liberals, they already have a party. Not the conservatives, there is a reason they don't vote for liberals.

> Over the next four years our energies should be focused on getting all Christian kids out of the government schools. If your kids are educated by people who are soft in the head, why would you expect them to grow up and not vote for people who are soft in the head? Students become like their teachers (Luke 6:40). Don't lament the fact that Obama won if over 90% of your children's teachers voted for him.

Listen to the man!
