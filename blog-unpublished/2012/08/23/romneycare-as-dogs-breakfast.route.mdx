> Like I have said before, I am not voting for Romney. And here’s the part where people will think I am driving in an erratic fashion down the back streets, trying to lose somebody. I would vote for Paul Ryan if he were at the top of the ticket – and yes, I know about the TARP vote. Perfectionism is not what we want. I also would have voted for Ron Paul, had he been the GOP nominee, despite his DADT vote. Why? Also because I am not a perfectionist. So why am I not voting for Romney? Because the principle of “not being a perfectionist” is not infinitely elastic. My joints aren’t that limber.

> First, I grant McCain was off the conservative reservation a number of times, but his lack of consistency was … consistent. It was the work of a crotchety old guy with a jumbled worldview. Romney’s pattern of moderate liberalism was far less mavericky, and thus more indicative of deeper ideological problems. Second, the recent vintage of some of Romney’s positive changes (pro-choice to pro-life) bothers me, and seems completely tied up with his desire to be president. On top of that, add Romney’s refusal to disavow that dog’s breakfast Romneycare. I don’t want a president who thinks that anything like that is a good idea. Remember, he’s the one who is going to “replace” Obamacare. With what, champ? And last, without pretending that McCain was in any way a good Christian, he at least was one.

Of late I haven’t been all that happy with Wilson on politics, but this article is a good one. Go read it, it’s worth it.
