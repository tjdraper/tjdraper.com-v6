I’m an ExpressionEngine guy and I build ExpressionEngine websites. My most recent project involved a shopping cart. I used an awesome shopping cart add-on for EE called [Cartthrob](http://cartthrob.com/). I can’t say enough good things about it. But I did run into some limitations with the default discount plugins available. But it is an extensible discount interface if you know PHP. I don’t know it that well, but I have a friend who helped me. We wrote a plugin that scratches a big itch. Here it is if anyone needs it:
