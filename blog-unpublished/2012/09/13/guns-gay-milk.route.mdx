> Now in this sense, I absolutely believe in gay rights. Homosexuals are people and _habeus corpus_ applies to them as much as to anybody else. They have a right to a fair and speedy trial. They have a right to not be convicted of a crime on the basis of stupid rumors. In fact, I cannot think of a single genuine right that I have that homosexuals do not have together with me, and for the same reasons.

> At this point in the proceedings, someone clears his throat and says, “Umm, marriage? You have a right to marry, and they do not.” But “marry” is not an unspecific verb with no direct object. I have the right to marry a woman, and so do they. A man and a woman together is _what marriage is_ . The fact that they don’t _want_ to marry a woman is their look out. I have a right to own a gun and so does your spinster Quaker aunt. The fact that she doesn’t _want_ to own a gun is perfectly acceptable. But what she is not free to do is redefine everything, and say that gun ownership is very important to her, but that for her, gun ownership means owning a quilting rack.

Yes! Yes! Yes!

> So say that homosexuals are given the right to marry, as has occurred in a number of states. Do Christian photographers have the right to turn down the job of shooting the wedding? Do Christians caterers get to say “No, thank you. We don’t do gay weddings.”? Do the Christian owners of a bed and breakfast have the right to decline being the scene of the honeymoon? No? Well, then, there’s your answer. Those driving this particular agenda are no friends of liberty.

> I sometimes describe the mentality of soft despotism that surrounds us on every hand as the “free chocolate milk for everybody” mindset. So let this be your litmus test. Do I have a right to buy chocolate milk if I want? Or is someone else being obligated to buy me a chocolate milk whenever I want?

The problem is these people are not at all interested in liberty or rights, they are interested in their specific agenda and they want to push it any way they can. They don't want rights, they want to be sinful.
