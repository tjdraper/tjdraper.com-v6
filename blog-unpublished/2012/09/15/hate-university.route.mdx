> [Douglas Wilson](http://www.dougwils.com/), of [Christ Church](http://www.christkirk.com/), Moscow, Idaho, was invited to Indiana University by [_Clearnote Church_](http://clearnotebloomington.com/) to talk about sexuality from a Biblical perspective. Bloomington Indiana is home to the Kinsey Institute, started by Alfred Kinsey who is famous for his experiments in sexuality. The videos below are the full lectures, as well as the very long Q&A that followed. A large crowd of “dissenters” gathered to demonstrate their disapproval of Wilson’s message in word in action.

You should really watch all three vidoes, they are well worth the time (even if you are just in it for the entertainment value). Wilson comports himself well. A couple of thoughts.

1.  Who is it that's being hateful here? The "peace-loving" homosexuals, or the "hate-filled" pastor?
2.  Why, if you are a non-Christian homosexual, atheist, etc. would you come to an event like this if not to cause trouble and spew hate for the speaker?
3.  The lack of apparent educational level amongst these adults attending college is appalling. Many (most?) of these young adults have no idea how to think clearly or logically. It makes one wonder what they are teaching in these colleges these days. Indeed, many of the question askers could not form clear and/or coherent sentences. There was one particularly sad case of a wayward young man who kept trying to accuse Wilson of being a hypocrite because "nothing you are saying is connecting". Ever hear of a non-sequitur?
4.  Pastor Wilson does a very good job of not stooping to their level, but communicating clearly and in a way that is not really able to be reproached, though of course many of those present do because they are God-haters. One particularly great example is when asked the question, "Is it possible to be homosexual and Christian," Wilson reponds, "Yes... Oh, you were expecting a different answer?" He goes on to explain, and he does so well, but this is such a great example of shutting down the opposition. Of course you can be a sinner and be a Chrisian, that's kind of the point.

So go on and watch this through.
