That is what keeps the peace. And that is what we will have in a Romney-Ryan administration."

> The money quote is italicized by me, and I should begin my discussion of how appalling it is by acknowledging (in the abstract) that there could be an innocent construction of these words, one with the needed caveats built in. It is possible (on paper) that this is not a reference to the doctrine of American exceptionalism, and it simply an acknowledgement of what must be done tactically with the current pieces that are still on the chessboard. Only by the confident exercise of the black knight will the white pieces be overcome, so that we can start the next game.

> But I don't think so. The language of those who want to project American power abroad (and not by "leading from behind" or by other means of "soft power") is language that has consistently been messianic. The things that might go without saying in a more righteous generation do _not_ go without saying in ours. America is not the Savior; America is one of the nations of men that must be saved. This kind of language is how political idolatries take root

American Exceptionalism is a real problem, and Ron Paul was the only candidate that understood that problem at all.
