> Marvel’s _The Avengers_ releases for Home Entertainment this week and we’re **giving you a chance to win a copy!** Details and rules below.
>
> We’ll give you your choice of either a Blu-ray or iTunes download. Everyone has their preference when it comes to physical versus digital copies. The advantage of Blu-ray is that it has a place on your shelf, you can physically loan out your copy — you have a hard physical copy. The advantage of iTunes is the instant gratification, the ability to download the film from iCloud again and again, or watch it instantly on your Apple TV, or any other Apple device or PC running iTunes. You choose (if you win, and you have another preference, let us know and we’ll see if we can accommodate you).
