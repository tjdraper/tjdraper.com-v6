title: The Stupidity of Users

I know I don’t post here very much and I should probably just close this weblog down since I obviously don't have time for it. But this is something I have to say and I have no where else to say.

The thing that is consuming all of my time is MovieByte — that is, all the time that is not spent editing film or designing websites for people. One of the ways we are pushing MovieByte to grow is by paying Facebook to feature select posts in the timelines of folks that haven't liked our page. Obviously we are trying to target people would be interested and who might click "like" on our page.

But the larger point is, this is one of the ways in which Facebook makes its money. Facebook is a free service to users, they can't keep the lights on with just your good looks (because, depending on who you are, that might not get them very far).

Now, we do use sponsored posts quite sparingly, but we did recently push one — a post about our [podcast with special guest Anthony Pascale](http://moviebyte.com/mbpodcast/40) of TrekMovie.com in which we talk about all things related to the new _Star Trek Into Darkness_ trailer. This campaign has been running for a couple of days. But today, we got feedback from a user...

Well, let me back up. In your newsfeed, you can click an "X" button on a sponsored post to indicate that you don't like it and want to hide it from your newsfeed. Facebook uses that info from you to target better ads and sponsored posts to you specifically. But when you click the "X", Facebook also shows you a link with the option to provide feedback to the poster of the sponsored post.

So we received a message which stated simply that they did not appreciate the post and to remove it.

Now, this user obviously has no idea how any of this works or the system that is in place. All they could see was an ad in their timeline and they did not like it. Users don't want to see ads on Facebook, or anywhere really. And yet they want everything to be free. I would be willing to bet every cent I owned that if Facebook started charging users for using their service, that this person would immediately cancel their Facebook account.

The problem here is of course this person has not thought one little bit about how Facebook is supposed to provide their free service. If Facebook did not have a way to monetize, they would not be able to provie the service to peopel for free. This is really a larger problem with the way of thinking for most people. Everyone wants everything for free, but hardly a person among us wants to pay for anything they use that adds value to their life.

This is why I try to pay for things I use that I like and that add value to my life whenever possible.
