While I am opposed to "Gay Marriage" (because there is no such thing as a marriage between two people of the same gender), I am not really bothering to follow this supreme court thing too much right now. Ultimately I do care about the outcome to some extent, but really only as a barometer of the culture and how far we've progressed down this road.

But really that we have even come this far, that something like this is before the supreme court is an indicator that we already lost the battle for the heart and soul of this nation. Make no mistake, my eschatological position is a positive one, but that does not mean that nations will not rebel against the Lord, and this nation is one in rebellion.
