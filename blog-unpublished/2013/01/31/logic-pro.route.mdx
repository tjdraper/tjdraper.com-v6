For many years I have been a film/video editor working with Final Cut Pro. I know Final Cut Pro 7 inside and out, like the back of my hand as they say.

But it was not always so. I got my start in media using Digital Audio Workstations â€” well just one actually: MX Trax. Behold if you will:

Audio editors have come a long way, and you know, not necessarily for the better, in my opinion. The basics are certainly here. MX Trax was not the most user friendly of interfaces but I still think it was more user friendly than many options available today. I knew relatively little about computers and software back in these days (this would have been around 1999 to 2000 or so), but I was able enough to intuit what I needed to do to get my audio and mixes where I generally wanted them to be.
