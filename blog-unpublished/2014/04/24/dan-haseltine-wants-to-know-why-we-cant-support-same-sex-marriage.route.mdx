> Contemporary Christian music isn’t a format where one might think to look for vocal supporters of same-sex marriage, but as with anything else times are changing. Dan Haseltine, front-man for the popular Christian band Jars of Clay, yesterday took to [his Twitter account](https://twitter.com/scribblepotemus) in a series of posts supportive of same-sex marriage, posting “Not meaning to stir things up BUT… is there a non-speculative or non ‘slippery slope’ reason why gays shouldn’t marry? I don’t hear one.” He went on to write “I’m trying to make sense of the conservative argument. But it doesn’t hold up to basic scrutiny. Feels akin to women’s suffrage. I just don’t see a negative effect to allowing gay marriage. No societal breakdown, no war on traditional marriage. ?? Anyone?”

> Haseltine compares the issue to civil rights struggles in the past, and asserts regarding Biblical arguments against same-sex marriage that “I don’t think scripture ‘clearly’ states much of anything regarding morality.”

Sad. I’ve met and worked with Dan (not that he would probably even remember who I am) and I’m sad that he can’t see the clarity of scripture on this matter.

Yes, Dan, there is a non-slippery slope argument against "gay marriage," it's called the the law of God. As a Christian, it's shameful that you do not understand this.

No, this is not akin to women's suffrage, and my argument against gay marriage has less to do with societal breakdown and more to do with God's law. Societal breakdown would be a result of abandoning the moral law of God — which is quite clear by the way — but is not the most important consideration here.

What does the Bible Say?
------------------------

You want some arguments from scripture Dan? Here they are:

[**Leviticus 18:22**](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18:22)

> Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

[**Leviticus 20:13**](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&version=KJV)

> If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

**[Romans 1:26-27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A26-27&version=KJV)**

> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

[**1 Corinthians 6:9-10**](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A9-10&version=KJV)

> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

I could go on, but it would be pointless. And even if you believe that the Old Testament is not applicable today (I believe it is), I have presented scripture from both old and new that is anything but unclear. There are many things in the Bible that are less clear than we might like them to be, but this is certainly not one of them. God's position is so crystal clear on this that anyone who would say otherwise is in clear rebellion to God. Dan, if you ever read this (I have no reason to believe you would), I would call you to repent and turn to Jesus. Turn to the CLEAR (yes it is clear) teachings of the scriptures and repent of this wickedness.

And it is clearly wrong that the scripture does not clearly state anything with regards to morality. This is foolishness and wickedness in the eyes of God and must be repented of. Turn again to Christ my brother!

Gay Friends?

> He goes on to write that “I think the vast interpretation has left room for people to deal inhumanly and unlovingly toward others that don’t fit their guidelines” and that “I don’t particularly care about Scriptures stance on what is ‘wrong.’ I care more about how it says we should treat people.”

This is so sad and a clear abandoning of the scriptures. He does not even hide it. He says he does not care what the scripture says about the one thing, he cares what scripture says about the other thing. He is elevating one thing in scripture above another at his own whims.

But as to the point, what should our response to homosexuals be in our day and age? We must call them to repent. This is not treating them as less than human, this is what we as believers are called to do with all sin. If a "straight" brother or sister is sinning, if he/she has a lust problem, if he/she has unnatural affection for someone of the same or opposite sex that should be reserved for a spouse, if he/she is sleeping with someone outside of marriage — of the same or opposite sex — we must call them to repentance.

I can't think of anyone right at this moment that I know personally and interact with constantly who is "gay" or anyone who admits it anyway, but I have known some in the past. I did not treat them as less than human. I treated them as any sinner who needed to repent — and trust me that is a lot. In fact that is all of us. You, me, everyone.

Repent and believe the gospel.

And Dan, you must repent of wishing we could allow the wicked abomination today's society would like to call "gay marriage" because the Bible clearly calls it an abomination. Repent and turn to Christ!
