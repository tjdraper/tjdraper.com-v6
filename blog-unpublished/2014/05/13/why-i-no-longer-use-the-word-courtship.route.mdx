title: Why I No Longer Use the Word Courtship
type: article

Words mean something. If I say to you, "I'm happy," you immediately know something about my emotional state.

If I tell you I'm a Christian, you understand instantly that I follow the Lord Jesus Christ.

If I tell you I'm a Presbyterian, things might start to get a little more fuzzy, but you have a basic concept of what I believe, what kind of a church I likely attend (as I said, it's a little more fuzzy these days but the word does still have some meaning).

However, these days, if I tell you I believe in courtship, it is pretty much meaningless. If I say my wife and I courted for several months and then were engaged, some of you will assume we didn't really get to know each other and didn't spend any time together. Maybe some of you picture me in a suite and tie, and maybe a coat with tails walking up and knocking on her door, conversing with her father for an hour, then helping her up into my horse drawn carriage for our evening outing (okay, most of you probably wouldn't go that far but I thought it was funny).

More importantly, there is a modern courtship movement that has morphed into a judgmental monster that I no longer recognize. If you don't do it just according to the perscribed formula, if you deviate one step out of line from what "I" say you should, you have left the faith.
