I would like to introduce you all to [MovingTruth.com](http://www.movingtruth.com), co-founded by myself, and my brother-in-law, [David](http://dpricejr.blogspot.com/). MovingTruth is an online community of film makers, graphic designers, and photographers seeking to bring honor and glory to the Lord in all that they do. Following is a quote from the MovingTruth.com purpose statement:

> The concept behind Moving Truth is not that truth moves and that we must keep up with its ever changing progress. No, God is truth and God is the same yesterday today and forever. The concept of moving truth is our work must proclaim God’s truth. The bible says in Ephs 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Photography along with cinematography are both powerful ways of spotlighting aspects of God’s truth and blessings on our lives. He has indeed not left us desolate in this fallen world He has equiped us with spiritual armor. He has enabled and commanded us, His people to communicate truth, both through our lives as well as our work. We are to worship God with all that we do.
