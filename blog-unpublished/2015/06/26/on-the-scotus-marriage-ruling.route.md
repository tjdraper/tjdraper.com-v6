<p>Everyone has a <em>hot take</em> on the ruling, so I know I'm only adding my voice to a cacophony of voices — but I do have an opinion to share. As usual it will offend most people on both sides of the isle.</p>

<p>First, the ruling means nothing. You read that right, nothing. It means nothing as far as marriage is concerned. Yes, my wife and I have a state-issued marriage license for many reasons — not the least of which are taxes, children, accounting, expectation, laws of the land, and more. But that license is not what makes us married. If we had stood at the front of the church and made our vows before God and those present, then proceeded to our honeymoon suite without that license, I do not for a second believe we would have been in sin. We made a covenant of marriage before God and witnesses. That is what makes us married.</p>

<p>The reason the ruling means nothing is the same reason a marriage license means nothing. As a Christian libertarian I wish we could get government out of marriage. Marriage is an institution of God and He sets the parameters. While the ruling may be a sign of the rejection of God and the moral standards He set forth, it is nothing more. Marriage is a sacred institution and it continues to be what it has always been — a convenant between a man and a woman to enter into a complimentary state of one flesh union.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have gay friends. Shocking, right? Sometimes what I have to say offends them and sometimes those gay friends no longer want to be friends with me if and when they find out I believe acting on their gay impulses is sin. Other gay friends accept that I believe it is sin and ignore me when I say something about it they don't like. I'm willing to be friends with all manner of folks based on 1 Corinthians 5:9-10:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they find what I have to say offensive — because I must witness for Christ and condemn sin — and no longer wish to associate with me, so be it. But I will not refuse to keep company with them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it helps to remember God is still sovereign. If you are offended and threatened by what has happened, I would ask you to re-examine your understanding of God and your place in the world. The world hates God and His morality — and by extension they will often hate His people. The ruling today is the latest manifestation of that. I condemn the actions of the SCOTUS because they believe they can interfere with or dictate the terms of a divine institution. But I am not worried about it or surprised. I hope to continue to live my life as I have always done. I plan to continue loving my wife and my children as God has called me to do. By God’s grace, I will continue to walk a fine line of standing for righteousness and declaring to be sin what God has called sin while maintaining friendships with those who are not believers and who sin in these areas. And I pray by God’s grace I can demonstrate that the only difference between them (unbelievers) and me is not that I think I am better or that I don't or haven't sinned, but rather my sins are forgiven and I belong to Christ. I am the same as they are — utterly wicked, conceived in sin. In my natural state I hate God as much as the most rabid and angry God hater. I pray God will use me to move in the hearts of whom he will to save them.</p>

<p>That's my hot take. God is on the throne.</p>
